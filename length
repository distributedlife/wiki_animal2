<p>Egg laying may occur from November to August in <span>Sudan</span> and <span>Arabia</span>, October to May in <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Somalia</span>, year around in <span>East Africa</span> (with a peak of June to December) and anywhere from April to November in Africa from <span>Zambia</span> southwards. In an unusual behaviour for eagles, the males may bring food to females before egg laying and, more typically, males bring almost all food during the incubation stage. Two eggs are generally laid, though a range of one to three is known. The eggs are rather elongated ovals and being chalky white sometimes with a bluish tinge or a few reddish-brown marking, measuring from 71 to 83.4 mm (2.80 to 3.28 in) in length and 56-62 mm (2.2-2.4 in) in width, with an average of 76.9 mm &#xD7; 58.6 mm (3.03 in &#xD7; 2.31 in). The eggs are laid at three day intervals starting in the middle of the day. Both sexes incubate, but the female takes the major share and tends to sit all night over them. Sometimes, the male may sit for 40-50% of the day with more shifts for him towards the end of incubation. These are close-sitters, which are not easily disturbed off the nest. Incubation is 43 to 47 days. Hatching happens at about to 2-3 days apart, with about 24 hours from the first chipping of the egg&#x2019;s surface to complete hatching. One egg is sometimes infertile and the second egg tends to be about 10% smaller. The Verreaux's Eagle is considered an &#x201C;obligate cainist&#x201D;, that is the older sibling normally kills the younger one (in more than 90% of observed nests), by either starvation or direct attack. Aggression may continue for up to 70 days after hatching. At one time no cases of two young successfully reaching the fledging stage were known, however a couple of cases of two healthy fledglings from a nest have been recorded. Siblicide is regularly observed in raptorial birds, including unrelated families like <span>owls</span> and <span>skuas</span> and is common, even typical, of <i>Aquila</i> eagles. The behaviour is most commonly explained as a kind of insurance policy, with the second nestling existing both to act as a backup if the first egg or nestling perishes and to mitigate the stressful workload demanded of the parent raptors in feeding, brooding and defending the young. The odds of survival for the second fledging are better in the Golden Eagle and other temperate-breeding <i>Aquila</i> eagles, possibly due to a shorter nesting stage in these species. In roughly 20% of Golden Eagle nests and in some cases, such as prey-rich areas of <span>North America</span>, about half of the nests will successfully produce two fledglings. In the Verreaux's Eagle, no food is given to the hatchling in the first 36 hours, thereafter they are regularly feed. Early in the fledging stage, the young is brooded up to 90% of the time. After 20 days, parents spend up to 20% of time with their eaglet around the nest, not brooding in daylight after 21 days. Feathers appear through the down at about 34 days, by 60 days feathers cover the down. In Equatorial Africa, the eaglet fledges from the nest at 95-99 days, though sometimes as little as 90 days further south. In the Golden Eagle, the fledging stage is roughly 35 days shorter. The young Verreaux's Eagle takes its first flight and then returns to the nest for the first fortnight. In the early fledging period, the male brings more food, later it is largely the female. At some point during the post-fledging stage, she ceases to roost with the young one and sits with the male at some distance, a behaviour that seems to vary from nest to nest in timing. After 45-50 days, food is caught by the parents but is likely eaten by themselves and not brought to the young. After leaving the nest, family parties may be together for up to 6 months. The eaglet grows stronger after the first month and accompanies the parents on hunting forays away from the nest. It often breeds every year, occasionally only on every other year.</p>

A male will weigh on average around 5.6 kg (12 lb) and is larger than a typical female of 4.9 kg (11 lb). The signature feature of the species is its huge, bulbous <span>bill</span>, which is straw-coloured with erratic greyish markings. The <span>exposed culmen</span> (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is 18.8 to 24 cm (7.4 to 9.4 in). The sharp edges in the mandibles help the shoebill to decapitate their prey and also to discard any vegetation after prey has been caught. As in the <span>pelicans</span>, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a <span>tarsus</span> length of 21.7 to 25.5 cm (8.5 to 10.0 in). The shoebill's feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching 16.8 to 18.5 cm (6.6 to 7.3 in) in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as <span>herons</span> and <span>cranes</span>.

This caused an underestimate of the total weight of the whale, due to the loss of blood and other fluids. As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific appear to be smaller on average than those from sub-Antarctic waters. Nevertheless, measurements between 150-170 tonnes (170-190 short tons) were recorded of animals up to 27 metres (89 ft) in length. The weight of an individual 30 metres (98 ft) long is believed by the American <span>National Marine Mammal Laboratory</span> (NMML) to be in excess of 180 tonnes (200 short tons). The largest blue whale accurately weighed by NMML scientists to date was a female that weighed 177 tonnes (195 short tons).</p>

<p>Mating starts in late autumn and continues to the end of winter. Little is known about mating behaviour or breeding grounds. Females typically give birth once every two to three years at the start of the winter after a <span>gestation period</span> of 10 to 12 months. The calf weighs about 2.5 tonnes (2.8 short tons) and is around 7 metres (23 ft) in length. Blue whale calves drink 380-570 litres (100-150 U.S. gallons) of milk a day. Blue whale milk has an energy content of about 18,300 kJ/kg (4,370 kcal/kg). The calf is <span>weaned</span> after six months, by which time it has doubled in length. Sexual maturity is typically reached at five to ten years of age. In the Northern Hemisphere, whaling records show that males averaged 20-21 m (66-69 ft) and females 21-23 m (69-75 ft) at sexual maturity, while in the Southern Hemisphere it was 22.6 and 24 m (74 and 79 ft), respectively. In the Northern Hemisphere, as adults, males averaged 24 m (79 ft) and females 25 m (82 ft), while in the Southern Hemisphere males averaged 25 m (82 ft) and females 26.5 m (87 ft). In the North Pacific, photogrammetric studies have shown blue whale adults today average 21.6 m (71 ft), with a maximum of over 24.4 m (80 ft) - although a 26.5 m (87 ft) female stranded near <span>Pescadero, California</span> in 1979.</p>

The white rhinoceros has square lips used for eating grass. The black rhinoceros can also be distinguished from the white rhinoceros by its size, smaller skull, and ears; and by the position of the head, which is held higher than the white rhinoceros, since the black rhinoceros is a browser and not a grazer. This key differentiation is further illustrated by the shape of the two species mouths (lips): the "square" lip of the white rhinoceros is an adaptation for grazing, and the "hooked" lip of the black rhinoceros is an adaptation to help browsing.</p>

<p>Malte Andersson and colleagues tested Darwin&#x2019;s (and Fisher&#x2019;s) theory of female preference for ornamentation as the cause of extreme elongation of the male Long-tailed Widowbird&#x2019;s tail. They changed the length of males&#x2019; tails and studied their relative mating success. Early in the breeding season, the territories of thirty-six males were mapped and the numbers of nests were counted. The experimenters used each male as his own control by subtracting the number of nests in each male&#x2019;s territory before treatment from the total of nests after treatment. This reduced the influence of initial variation among male territories on the outcome of the experiment. In a randomized block experiment, the color-ringed males were partitioned among nine groups of four males each. These groups were similar in territory quality and tail length. The tail of one randomly selected male within each group was cut to about 14 centimeters (5 inches) in length. Each removed feather was then glued to the corresponding feather of another male, elongating his tail by 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches). The two other males in the group served as controls.

In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light grey, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating at the base of the tail. Indistinct black smudges are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light grey, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2-3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter grey around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the shoulder region, in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured.

They obtain this food by digging foraging tunnels to reach plant roots; these tunnels are narrower than their main tunnels and may be as little as 0.5 to 2.5 centimetres (0.20 to 0.98 in) below the surface. Food may also be taken to deeper storage chambers to store up for hard times, or when a female is raising young.

The fur begins to grow on day seven, and the eyes open on day nine. The young grow rapidly, and begin to take solid food around day seventeen, being fully weaned at four weeks of age. By five weeks, siblings begin to show aggression towards one another, and they leave to establish their own burrows at around seven weeks.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, accounting for much of the animal's vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the <span>cervical vertebrae</span>, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long. They comprise 52-54 percent of the length of the giraffe's <span>vertebral column</span>, compared with the 27-33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe&#x2019;s closest living relative, the <span>okapi</span>. This elongation largely takes place after birth, as giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a <span>nuchal ligament</span>, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior <span>thoracic vertebrae</span>, giving the animal a hump.</p>

The height at the shoulder is 70 to 80 cm (28 to 31 in) and the tail is 25 to 35 cm (9.8 to 13.8 in) long. Unlike the larger <span>spotted hyena</span>, there are no sizable differences between the sexes, though males may be slightly larger than the females. The average adult male weighs 40.2 to 43.7 kg (89 to 96 lb), while the average female weighs 37.7 to 40.2 kg (83 to 89 lb). The normal upper weight limit for the species is 55 kg (121 lb), although an occasional outsized specimen can weigh up to 67.6 to 72.6 kg (149 to 160 lb). The coat is long and shaggy, particularly on the tail and back. The general fur color is dark brown, while the head is gray, the upper body tawny and the legs grey with dark horizontal stripes. Erectile hairs 305 mm (12 in) in length cover the neck and back. Brown hyenas have powerful jaws: young animals can crack the leg bones of <span>springboks</span> within five minutes of birth, though this ability deteriorates with age as their teeth gradually wear. The skulls of brown hyenas are larger than those of the more northern <span>striped hyenas</span>, and their dentition is more robust, indicating less generalised dietary adaptations. Brown hyenas possess an anal gland below the base of the tail, which produces <span>a black and white paste</span>.

<p>The male masked shrike is a striking bird, with black and white plumage and orange flanks. This medium-sized <span>passerine</span> is the smallest shrike at 17-18 cm in length. Its upperparts, crown, long tail and wings are mainly black; there are large white patches on the wings which are conspicuous in flight. The face is white except for a broad black line running back from the eye. The rest of the underparts are white with orange flanks. In the female and young birds the upperparts are dark grey rather than black, and the orange flanks are less bright and reduced in extent. The juvenile has heavily <span>vermiculated</span> grey upperparts, and white underparts which are also vermiculated. Masked shrike breeds in open woodland and cultivated country.

<p>The <b>crabeater seal</b> (<i>Lobodon carcinophaga</i> or <i>carcinophagus</i>) is a <span>true seal</span> with a circumpolar distribution around the coast of <span>Antarctica</span>. They are medium- to large-sized (over 2 m in length), relatively slender and pale-colored, found primarily on the free-floating <span>pack ice</span> that extends seasonally out from the Antarctic coast, which they use as a platform for resting, mating, social aggregation and accessing their prey. They are by far the most abundant seal species in the world. While population estimates are uncertain, there are at least 7 million and possibly as many as 75 million individuals. This success of this species is due to its specialized predation on the abundant <span>Antarctic krill</span> of the <span>Southern Ocean</span>, for which it has uniquely adapted, sieve-like tooth structure. Indeed, its scientific name, translated as "lobe-toothed (<i>lobodon</i>) crab eater (<i>carcinophagus</i>)", refers specifically to the finely lobed teeth adapted to filtering their small <span>crustacean</span> prey. Despite its name, crabeater seals do not eat crabs. As well as being an important krill predator, the crabeater seal is an important component of the diet of <span>leopard seals</span> (<i>Hydrurga leptonyx</i>), which consume about 80% of all crabeater pups.</p>

using('mesoplodon layardii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The overall body shape of the strap-toothed whale is fairly typical for a mesoplodont, except for the large size. Male specimens have large and peculiar teeth even for the genus; the teeth emerge from the lower jaw and grow upward and back at a 45 degree angle to encircle the upper jaw and nearly close it. These teeth can sometimes grow to over 30 centimetres (0.98 ft) in length. The teeth have dorsally projecting denticles, and are apparently used for fighting. <span>Barnacles</span> are frequently found on the teeth, as well. Why the species would grow teeth that severely cut back on the size of prey it can consume is uncertain. The <span>melon</span> is somewhat bulbous, and blends into the beak shortly before the strap teeth. The beak itself is fairly long, with a relatively straight mouthline. The coloration of this species is also unusual for a mesoplodont, since it is rather bold; most of the body is black except for a white areas on the front of the beak, the throat, an area behind the head in a shape reminiscent of a cape, and near the genitals. Juveniles do not have this coloration and are typically <span>countershaded</span>, dark above and light below. Scars and <span>cookie cutter shark</span> bites are also present. Males can reach around 5.9 metres (19 ft), whereas females reach 6.2 metres (20 ft) and likely weigh around 1,000-1,300 kilograms (2,200-2,900 lb), indicating they are probably the largest species in the genus.

<p>Behind only the tiger, the lion is the second largest living felid in length and weight. Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region. The lion's skull has broader nasal openings than the tiger, however, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually, only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light buff to yellowish, reddish, or dark ochraceous brown. The underparts are generally lighter and the tail tuft is black. Lion cubs are born with brown <span>rosettes</span> (spots) on their body, rather like those of a leopard. Although these fade as lions reach adulthood, faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts, particularly on lionesses.</p>

Under current classification, it is the heaviest extant owl outside of the <i><span>Bubo</span></i> genus. Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 40.7-44.7 cm (16.0-17.6 in) and the tail is 20.7-24.3 cm (8.1-9.6 in) long. They are well adapted to their aquatic lifestyle. Unlike most owls, they have minimal feathering on the toes and the tarsus, thus minimizing the amount of plumage that gets wet while fishing. Like diurnal raptors that specialize in fish, they have spiky scales on the bottoms of their feet that help them grip slippery fish. Since hearing and auditory stealth is not important to its hunting techniques, this owl does not have strong hearing and does not have the soft edges to its flight feathers that most owls share, which makes them almost impossible to hear in flight.</p>

<p>The Crowned Eagle is a very large eagle. Measuring from 80 to 99 cm (31 to 39 in) in length, it is the fifth longest extant eagle in the world. The female, at a weight of 3.2-4.7 kg (7 lb 1 oz-10 lb 6 oz), is around 10-15% larger than the male, at a weight of 2.55-4.12 kg (5 lb 10 oz-9 lb 1 oz). An average body mass of 3.64 kg (8.0 lb) was given in one account. Elsewhere, an average of 3.8 kg (8.4 lb) has been claimed. Overall, they are the 9th heaviest living eagle species. The wingspan typically ranges from 1.51 to 1.81 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in). The largest authenticated wingspan for a female was 1.9 m (6 ft 3 in), with a claim of wingspans of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) needing confirmation. This eagle&#x2019;s wingspan is quite short for the bird&#x2019;s size, being around the same mean width as that of a <span>Tawny Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila rapax</i>) or a <span>Short-toed Snake Eagle</span> (<i>Circaetus gallicus</i>), species that weigh about half as much as a Crowned Eagle. However, the somewhat boxy and rounded wings are quite broad, being broader than, for example, the much longer-winged <span>Golden Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>). The wing morphology of the species gives it maneuverability in its densely wooded environment. The <span>wing chord</span> measures 44.5-53.2 cm (17.5-20.9 in), with a median of 46.7 cm (18.4 in) in males and 51.2 cm (20.2 in) in females . While it, on average, is less heavy and has a smaller wingspan than the often sympatric <span>Martial Eagle</span>, its average total length exceeds that of the Martial Eagle thanks to its much longer tail. The Crowned Eagle&#x2019;s tail is from 30 to 41 cm (12 to 16 in) long, with a median of 31.5 cm (12.4 in) in males and 34.8 cm (13.7 in) in females. The <span>bill</span> is of a medium size relative to its body size, with one large museum specimen&#x2019;s bill measuring 5.5 cm (2.2 in) in length from the gape, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) in <span>culmen length</span> and 3.3 cm (1.3 in) in bill depth.</p>

<p>In South Africa the Crowned Eagle lays its eggs from September to October; in <span>Rhodesia</span>, it lays from May to October; mainly near October around the <span>Congo River</span>; anywhere from June to November in <span>Kenya</span>, with a peak in August through October; in Uganda from December to July; and in <span>West Africa</span>, laying peaks in October. The clutch of the Crowned Eagle either contains 1 or 2 eggs. Often in <span>East Africa</span>, just one egg is laid. Eggs are usually just white, though may sometimes be overlaid with sparse red-brown markings. The eggs are moderate in size, averaging 68.2 mm &#xD7; 53.6 mm (2.69 in &#xD7; 2.11 in), with ranges of 60.9-75.5 mm (2.40-2.97 in) in length and 50.8-57.9 mm (2.00-2.28 in) in width. When a natural disaster befalls a nest, a replacement may be made in 2 months time. Incubation lasts for approximately 49 days. 80-90% of egg incubation is done by the female during the day. Food is mainly brought to the nest by the male in the early stages of breeding, though sometimes both sexes may deliver food. Male brings food to the incubating female every 3 to 5 days. When they initially hatch, the young tend to be quite quiet. If two eggs are laid, the younger one dies by starvation after being outcompeted for food by the older one or even directly killed by its older sibling. No nest of wild Crowned Eagles has been known to successfully produce more than one fledgling, though in captivity two have been known to survive with human interference (supplementally feeding the younger chick or taking it out of the nest). In cases where the older nestling dies, the younger one may be fed more regularly and survive.</p>

The strong legs of the ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the <span>tarsus</span> (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales: red in the male, black in the female. The tarsus of the ostrich is the largest of any living bird, measuring 39 to 53 cm (15 to 21 in) in length. The bird has just two toes on each <span>foot</span> (most birds have four), with the <span>nail</span> on the larger, inner toe resembling a <span>hoof</span>. The outer toe has no nail. The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Ostriches can run at a speed over 70 km/h (43 mph) and can cover 3 to 5 m (9.8 to 16.4 ft) in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), and the <span>wing chord</span> measurement of 90 cm (35 in) is around the same size as for the largest flying birds. The wings are used in mating displays and to shade chicks. The feathers lack the tiny hooks that lock together the smooth external feathers of flying birds, and so are soft and fluffy and serve as insulation. Ostriches can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. In much of their habitat, temperatures vary as much as 40 &#xB0;C (100 &#xB0;F) between night and day. Their temperature control mechanism relies on action by the bird, which uses its wings to cover the naked skin of the upper legs and flanks to conserve heat, or leaves these areas bare to release heat. They have 50-60 tail feathers, and their wings have 16 primary, four <span>alular</span> and 20-23 secondary feathers.</p>

<p>The great crested tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up to 1 m (3 ft), or by dipping from the surface, and food is usually swallowed in mid-air. Birds may forage up to 10 km (6 mi) from land in the breeding season. Prey size ranges from 7-138 mm (0.27-5.4 in) in length and up to 30 g (1.1 oz) in weight.

<p>As with all bustards, the female makes no real nest. The female Kori Bustard lays her eggs on the ground in a shallow, unlined hollow, rather than the typical scrape. This nest is usually located within 4 m (13 ft) of a tree or shrub, termite mound or an outcrop of rocks. The hollow may measure 300-450 mm (12-18 in) in diameter and be almost completely covered by the female when she's incubating. Due to their ground location, nests are often cryptic and difficult for a human to find, unless stumbled onto by chance. The same site is sometimes reused in successive years. The Kori Bustard is a solitary nester and there is no evidence of territoriality amongst the females. Usually two eggs are laid, though seldom 1 or 3 may be laid. Clutch size is likely correlated to food supply. They are cryptically colored with the ground color being dark buff, brown or olive and well marked and blotched with shades of brown, grey and pale purple. Eggs are somewhat glossy or waxy and have a pitted-looking surface. Egg size is 81 to 86 mm (3.2 to 3.4 in) in height and 58 to 61 mm (2.3 to 2.4 in) width.

It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a spectacular vertical single-column spout up to 12 metres (39 ft), typically 9 metres (30 ft). Its <span>lung</span> capacity is 5,000 litres (1320 U.S. gallons). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.</p>

<p>The fin whale is brownish to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally.

On the right lower jaw is a white or light gray "right mandible patch", which sometimes extends out as a light "blaze" laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw and back to just behind the blowholes. Two narrow dark stripes originate from the eye and ear, the former widening into a large dark area on the shoulder &#x2014; these are separated by a light area called the "interstripe wash". These markings are more prominent on individuals in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific, where they can appear indistinct. The left side exhibits similar but much fainter markings. Dark, oval-shaped areas of pigment called "flipper shadows" extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins. This type of <span>asymmetry</span> is seen in <span>Omura's whale</span> and occasionally in <span>minke whales</span>. It was <span>hypothesized</span> to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it sometimes circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales just as often circle to the left. There is no accepted hypothesis to explain the asymmetry. It has paired <span>blowholes</span> on a prominent splashguard and a broad, flat V-shaped <span>rostrum</span>. A single median ridge stops well short of the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the <span>chevron</span>, begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again. The whale has a series of 56-100 <span>pleats</span> or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the <span>chin</span> to the <span>navel</span> that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding. It has a curved, prominent <span>dorsal fin</span> that ranges in height from 26-75 centimeters (10-30 in) (usually 45-60 centimeters (18-24 in)) and averages about 51 centimetres (20 in), lying about three-quarters of the way along the back.

At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back. Besides the mane, the male olive baboon differs from the female in terms of size and weight and canine tooth size; males are, on average, 70 cm (28 in) tall while standing and females measure 60 cm (24 in) in height.

Reports of outsized specimens weighing 23 kg (51 lb), 34 kg (75 lb) and even "almost" 40 kg (88 lb) have been reported, but none of these giant sizes have been verified and some may be from unreliable sources. Among bustards, only male <span>Great Bustards</span> (<i>Otis tarda</i>) achieve similarly high weights, making the male Kori and Great not only the two largest bustards but also arguably the heaviest living flying animals. As a whole, other species, such as <span>Dalmatian Pelican</span> (<i>Pelecanus crispus</i>), <span>Andean Condor</span> (<i>Vultur gryphus</i>) and <span>Trumpeter Swan</span> (<i>Cygnus buccinator</i>), might weigh more on average between the sexes but are less sexually dimorphic in mass than the giant bustards. The female Kori Bustard weighs an average of 4.8 to 6.1 kg (11 to 13 lb), with a range of 3 to 7 kg (6.6 to 15.4 lb). Female length is from 80 to 120 cm (2 ft 7 in to 3 ft 11 in) and they usually stand less than 60 cm (2 ft 0 in) tall and have a wingspan of less than 220 cm (7 ft 3 in). The standard measurements of the male include a <span>wing chord</span> of 69.5 to 83 cm (27.4 to 32.7 in), a <span>tail</span> measures from 35.8-44.7 cm (14.1-17.6 in), a <span>culmen</span> from 9.5 to 12.4 cm (3.7 to 4.9 in) and a <span>tarsus</span> from 20 to 24.7 cm (7.9 to 9.7 in). Meanwhile, the female's standard measurements are a <span>wing chord</span> of 58.5 to 66.5 cm (23.0 to 26.2 in), a <span>tail</span> of 30.7 to 39.5 cm (12.1 to 15.6 in), a <span>culmen</span> from 7 to 10.4 cm (2.8 to 4.1 in) and a <span>tarsus</span> from 16 to 19.5 cm (6.3 to 7.7 in).

<p>Being a large, ground-dwelling bird species, the Kori Bustard is vulnerable to many of Africa's myriad of formidable terrestrial predators. <span>Leopards</span> (<i>Panthera pardus</i>), <span>caracals</span> (<i>Caracal caracal</i>), <span>cheetahs</span> (<i>Acinonyx jubatus</i>), <span>lions</span> (<i>Panthera leo</i>), <span>spotted hyena</span> (<i>Crocuta crocuta</i>), <span>African rock pythons</span> (<i>Python sebae</i>), <span>jackals</span> (<i>Canis</i> ssp.), <span>Verreaux's eagle</span> (<i>Aquila verreauxii</i>) and <span>martial eagles</span> (<i>Polemaetus bellicosus</i>) are amongst their potential natural predators. Additionally, <span>warthogs</span> (<i>Phacochoerus africanus</i>), <span>tawny eagles</span> (<i>Aquila rapax</i>), <span>mongooses</span> and <span>baboons</span> (<i>Papio</i> ssp.) may eat eggs and small chicks. When alarmed, Kori Bustards make barking calls and bend forward and spread their tail and wings to appear larger. Adults will growl when their young are threatened by predators. Chicks tend to be the most vulnerable to predators by far. Many, despite their cryptic camouflage and the mother's defenses, are regularly picked off by jackals and leopards at night. Up to 82% of Kori Bustard chicks die in their first year of life. When found with carmine bee-eaters, the smaller birds may incidentally provide some protection from predators due to their vigilance. The display of the adult male may make it more conspicuous to larger predators, such as hyenas or lions. A shock display may be performed when a bird is alarmed. While too large to be prey for most predatory birds, it is known that the Martial Eagle is a serious natural enemy even for adult bustards. In one documented attack by a Martial Eagle on an adult Kori Bustard, both birds ended up wounded, the eagle with a bleeding leg from the bustard's counterattack, but the bustard more seriously injured, with a broken wing and several open wounds. Although it walked away, the injured bustard in the confrontation was found dead the next morning, being fed on by a jackal.</p>

<p>Nesting takes place from September to February, and consists of a platform of leafy twigs, constructed by both sexes in the upper foliage of a tall tree and located from 10-25 m above ground, lofty eucalypts often being favoured. The clutch is of 2 (rarely 3) chalky-white eggs with reddish-brown blotches. Incubation is by both sexes or female only and lasts for 32-33 days.

<p>The shoebill is a tall bird, with a typical height range of 110 to 140 cm (43 to 55 in) and some specimens reaching as much as 152 cm (60 in). Length from tail to beak can range from 100 to 140 cm (39 to 55 in) and wingspan is 230 to 260 cm (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Weight has reportedly ranged from 4 to 7 kg (8.8 to 15.4 lb). A male will weigh on average around 5.6 kg (12 lb) and is larger than a typical female of 4.9 kg (11 lb). The signature feature of the species is its huge, bulbous <span>bill</span>, which is straw-coloured with erratic greyish markings. The <span>exposed culmen</span> (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is 18.8 to 24 cm (7.4 to 9.4 in). The sharp edges in the mandibles help the shoebill to decapitate their prey and also to discard any vegetation after prey has been caught. As in the <span>pelicans</span>, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a <span>tarsus</span> length of 21.7 to 25.5 cm (8.5 to 10.0 in). The shoebill's feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching 16.8 to 18.5 cm (6.6 to 7.3 in) in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as <span>herons</span> and <span>cranes</span>. The wings are broad, with a <span>wing chord</span> length of 58.8 to 78 cm (23.1 to 30.7 in), and well-adapted to <span>soaring</span>.</p>

<p>Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than 100 metres (330 ft) during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10 minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 20 minutes are common. The longest recorded dive is 36 minutes. The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.</p>

<p>Blue whales may be wounded, sometimes fatally, after colliding with ocean vessels, as well as becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including <span>sonar</span>, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1-8 kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25-100 Hz).

<p>Wattled Cranes commence their breeding season around April. Most nest are sloppily crushed impressions of grass along the border of a marsh. They may use an old spur-winged goose nest or make their own. Eggs are laid approximately 3 weeks after the nests are built. The average clutch size of the species is reportedly the smallest of any of the world's cranes, with an average of 1.6 eggs. Even if there are two eggs, usually only one chick successfully survives to hatch or fledge. The incubation period, roughly 33 to 36 days, is on average the longest of any crane and both parents participate. The chicks are immediately feed by both parents, which take shifts. After around 80 days, the chick(s) start to forage with their parents. At the first sign of any danger, the parents force their young into tall grasses to hide. The fledging period occurs at 100-150 days, the longest it takes any crane to fledge. The young remain with their parents for up to a year (when the next breeding period starts) and may gather in flocks with unrelated juveniles.</p>

<p>The golden jackal rarely hunts in groups, though packs of 8-12 jackals consisting of more than one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. When hunting singly, the golden jackal will trot around an area, occasionally stopping to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, it will conceal itself, quickly approach, then pounce. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams, driving their prey from one jackal to another. The golden jackal rarely catches hares, as they are faster than it. <span>Gazelle</span> mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single jackals, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs.

<p>The blue monkey is found in <span>evergreen</span> forests and montane <span>bamboo</span> forests, and lives largely in the forest canopy, coming to the ground infrequently. It is very dependent on humid, shady areas with plenty of water. It eats mainly <span>fruit</span> and leaves, but will take some slower-moving invertebrates. It prefers to live in tall trees which provide both food and shelter, and is therefore, like almost all guenons, suffering from the loss of its natural habitat. Where pine plantations replace natural forest, the monkey may be treated as a threat by foresters, since it sometimes strips the bark from exotic trees in a search for food or moisture. It is also hunted for bushmeat.</p>

<p>The white stork breeds in greater numbers in areas with open grasslands, particularly grassy areas which are wet or periodically flooded, and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forest and shrubland. They make use of grasslands, wetlands, and farmland on the wintering grounds in Africa. White storks were probably aided by human activities during the <span>Middle Ages</span> as woodland was cleared and new pastures and farmland were created, and they were found across much of Europe, breeding as far north as Sweden. The population in Sweden is thought to have established in the 16th century after forests were cut down for agriculture. About 5000 pairs were estimated to breed in the 18th century which declined subsequently. The first accurate census in 1917 found 25 pairs and the last pair failed to breed around 1955. The white stork is a rare visitor to the <span>British Isles</span>, as about 20 birds are seen in Britain every year, but there are no records of nesting.

<p>In short, for breeding the Montagu's Harrier requires a large open area, with sufficiently tall ground vegetation to afford cover without being overgrown. It favours posts on which both male and female can rest and survey the breeding area: these can be fenceposts, small trees, or rocky outcrops. When hunting, in any season, it prefers areas of low or sparse vegetation where prey is more visible. Densely settled areas are generally avoided and it is highly susceptible to disturbance.</p>

<p>Montagu's harriers breed for the first time when two or three years old, but occasionally one year old females may attempt to nest. Pairs form on the territory, when returning from migration. As the birds are tied to their former nesting sites, they probably mate with the same partner every year. The nest is built by the female, always in tall vegetation. It is a simple construction made of grass, used only for one season. The female lays 3 to 5 eggs which are incubated for 27-40 days. The young leave the nest after 28-42 days and are independent two weeks later.</p>

They communicate with each other using <span>pheromones</span> detected by <span>flehmen</span> and several forms of vocal communication. One of these is a metallic snort or an echoing "hick", that can be heard up to 1500 metres (1 mile) away.

When breeding in Eurasia, the corn crake's habitats would originally have included river meadows with tall grass and meadow plants including <span>sedges</span> and <span>irises</span>. It is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay, particularly moist traditional farmland with limited cutting or fertiliser use. It also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or <span>taiga</span>, on coasts, or where created by fire. Moister areas like wetland edges may be used, but very wet habitats are avoided, as are open areas and those with vegetation more than 50 cm (20 in) tall, or too dense to walk through. The odd bush or hedge may be used as a calling post. Grassland which is not mown or grazed becomes too matted to be suitable for nesting, but locally crops such as <span>cereals</span>, peas, <span>rape</span>, <span>clover</span> or potatoes may be used. After breeding, adults move to taller vegetation such as <span>common reed</span>, iris, or <span>nettles</span> to moult, returning to the to hay and <span>silage</span> meadows for the second brood. In China, <span>flax</span> is also used for nest sites.

<p>The female may be offered food by the male during courtship. He has a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.</p>

The crake also frequents maize, rice and cotton crops, derelict farmland and sugarcane plantations close to water. A wide range of grass species are used, with a preferred height of 0.3-1 m (1- 3 ft) tall but vegetation is acceptable up to 2 m (6 ft) tall. It normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the corn crake, and its breeding territories often contain or are close to thickets or <span>termite</span> mounds. It occurs from sea level to 2,000 m (6,500 ft) but is rare in the higher altitude grasslands. Its grassland habitat is frequently burned in the dry season, forcing the birds to move elsewhere. In an East African study, the average area occupied by one bird was 2.6 ha (6.4 acres) when breeding, and 1.97 to 2.73 ha (4.9-6.75 acres) at other times.

<p>Spotted hyenas usually hunt wildebeest either singly, or in groups of two or three. They catch adult wildebeest usually after 5 km (3 mi) chases at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mi/h). Chases are usually initiated by one hyena and, with the exception of cows with calves, there is little active defense from the wildebeest herd. Wildebeest will sometimes attempt to escape hyenas by taking to water though, in such cases, the hyenas almost invariably catch them. Zebras require different hunting methods to those used for wildebeest, due to their habit of running in tight groups and aggressive defence from <span>stallions</span>. Typical zebra hunting groups consist of 10-25 hyenas, though there is one record of a hyena killing an adult zebra unaided. During a chase, zebras typically move in tight bunches, with the hyenas pursuing behind in a <span>crescent</span> formation. Chases are usually relatively slow, with an average speed of 15-30 km/h. A stallion will attempt to place himself between the hyenas and the herd, though once a zebra falls behind the protective formation it is immediately set upon, usually after a chase of 3 km (1.8 mi). Though hyenas may harass the stallion, they usually only concentrate on the herd and attempt to dodge the stallion's assaults. Unlike stallions, mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas when their foals are threatened. Unlike wildebeest, zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas. When hunting <span>Thomson's gazelles</span>, spotted hyenas usually operate alone, and prey primarily on young fawns. Chases against both adult and young gazelles can cover distances of 5 km (3 mi) with speeds of 60 km/h (37 mi/h). Female gazelles do not defend their fawns, though they may attempt to distract hyenas by feigning weakness.</p>

The male is larger and heavier than the female, with a range of 5.1-7.5 kg (11-17 lb). The female is usually between 5 and 7 kg (11 and 15 lb). It is probably the tallest of the <span>storks</span> (though not the heaviest), due in no small part to it extremely long legs (tarsus length is up to 36.5 cm (14.4 in)). The long bill measures from 27.3 to 36 cm (10.7 to 14.2 in).

<p>The plains zebra is a highly social species forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; there are also bachelor groups. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators rather than attempting to hide; they bark or snort when they see a predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators such as dogs, hyenas and leopards to defend his harem. The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The striping pattern of the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates. One suggested function for the stripes is to provide <span>crypsis</span> for the animal in tall grass or in the dappled shade beneath bushes and trees. However, cryptically colored species like the <span>kudu</span> and <span>bushbuck</span> tend to be quiet and stealthy. They freeze when there is danger and flee only at the last moment. By contrast, the zebra is active and noisy, and makes no attempt to hide itself. Another suggestion is <span>motion camouflage</span>, that the stripes affect a predator's judgement of the zebra's size, distance and what direction it is going in. A 2014 study supports this hypothesis, finding that when moving the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, via two <span>visual illusions</span>, the <span>wagon wheel effect</span>, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the <span>barber pole illusion</span>, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction. A related hypothesis is that the stripes make it difficult for a predator to single out and learn about on an individual during a chase. Perhaps the best explanation for the stripes is that they serve a social function. Individual zebras can apparently recognize each other by their striping patterns. The stripes may also serve as visual cues for grooming. In addition, they could serve to help zebra groups stay together when they are fleeing. A 2012 study suggests that stripes may have developed to discourage biting flies. Experiments have demonstrated that the stripes polarize light in such a way that it discourages tabanids (biting flies) in a manner not shown with other coat patterns.</p>

<p>The plains zebra is highly social and usually forms small family groups called <span>harems</span>, which consist of a single stallion, several mares, and their recent offspring. The adult membership of a harem is highly stable, typically remaining together for months to years. Groups of all male "bachelors" also exist. These are stable groups of 2-15 males with an age-based hierarchy lead by a young male. These males stay in their groups until they are ready to start a harem. The bachelors prepare for their adult roles with play fights and greeting/challenge rituals, which take up most of their activities. Multiple harems and bachelor groups come together to form herds. Plains zebras are unusual among harem-holding species in forming these groups. In addition, pairs of harems may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this has only been observed in primates like the <span>gelada</span> and the <span>hamadryas baboon</span>.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Stallions form and expand their harems by abducting young mares from their natal harems. When a mare reaches sexual maturity, she will exhibit the <span>estrous</span> posture, which attracts nearby stallions, both bachelors and harem leaders. Her family stallion (likely her father) will chase off or fight stallions attempting to abduct her. Even after a young mare is isolated from her natal harem, the fight over her continues until her estrous cycle is over, and it starts again with the next estrous cycle. It is rare that the mare's original abductor keeps her for long. When the mare finally <span>ovulates</span>, the male that impregnates her keeps her for good. Thus, the mare becomes a permanent member of a new harem. The estrous posture of a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually non-existent.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Mares exist in a hierarchy, with the alpha female being the first to mate with the stallion and being the one to lead the group. When new mares are added to the group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus, the stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subsides. The most recently added females rank lowest. Females that become unfit or weak may drop in their rank, though. The female memberships of a harem stay intact even if a new stallion takes over. Females in a harem tend to be hostile to outside females. Zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, shoulders, and back with their teeth and lips. Mothers and foals groom the most often, followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behavior.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A stallion will defend his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion would issue a warning to the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion will lie still on the ground as if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, will strike and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The stallion mates with all his mares. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. The birthing peak is during the rainy season. She nurses the foal for up to a year. The stallion is generally intolerant of foals that are not his. It is possible that zebras practice <span>infanticide</span> and <span>feticide</span>, such incidences have been observed in both captive individuals. and in nature. In the film "Great Zebra Exodus," a mare was trying to protect her foal whose father was a fallen stallion from a new one Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk, run from danger, and suckle shortly after they are born. At the moment of birth, a mother zebra keeps any other zebra away from her foal, including the stallion, the other mares, and even the previous offspring. Later, though, they all bond. Within the group, a foal has the same rank as its mother. Plains zebra foals are protected by their mother as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Even with parental protection, up to 50% of zebra foals are taken by predation, disease, and starvation each year.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Young male zebras eventually leave their family groups. This is not because of sexual maturity or being kicked out by their fathers, but because their relationship with their mothers have faded after the birth of a sibling. The young stallion then seeks out other young stallions for company. Young females may stay in the harem until they are abducted by another stallion.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>For protection from land predators, the plains zebra retreats into open areas with good visibility at night. When the groups forage or sleep, one zebra will keep watch, and if a predator is spotted, it will bark or snort loudly. When being hunted by hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra harem stays close together and cooperates to protect threatened members, particularly the young. The harem stallion will go on the offensive and attack the dogs or hyenas. Though hyenas may harass the stallion, they usually only concentrate on the herd, and attempt to dodge the stallion's assaults. Unlike stallions, mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas or dogs when their foals are threatened. Unlike wildebeest, zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas. With lions, a zebra's best defense is to outpace them, as lions do not have as much endurance as hyenas or wild dogs. Cheetahs and leopards are mostly threats to foals as an adult zebra is fully capable of driving them away.</p>

using('equus zebra')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Mountain zebras do not aggregate into large herds like <span>plains zebras</span>; they form small family groups consisting of a single stallion and one to five mares, together with their recent offspring. Bachelor males live in separate groups and mature bachelors attempt to abduct young mares to establish a harem. In this they are opposed by the dominant stallion of the group.</p>

<p>Mares give birth to 1 foal at a time. The foal feeds mainly on its mothers milk for about a year, after which it is weaned onto solid <span>forage</span>. After 14-16 months, a male foal must leave the herd and form a new one once it matures. If the colt is too stubborn, it will stay and try a challenging fight with the stallion or lead mare, but generally no foal is ready to take over a group until it is several years old.</p>

<p>Orange cheeks like a lot of grass. They eat the seed heads, they forage at its roots for tiny insects, and build their nests directly in it. Some open tall shrubbery and dead, scraggly branches should be provided for roosting. The floor should be composed of a good, dry substrate. Otherwise, the enclosure should have stands of clump and/or runner grasses and reeds which grow 40 cm or taller.

<p>The Thomson's gazelle lives in Africa's savannas and grassland habitats, particularly the <span>Serengeti</span> region of <span>Kenya</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>. It has narrow habitat preferences, preferring short grassland with dry, sturdy foundation. It does, however, migrate into tall grassland and dense woodland. Gazelles are mixed feeders.

using('eudorcas thomsonii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Thomson's gazelles are dependent on short grass. Their numbers are highly concentrated at the beginning of the rains since the grass grows quickly. They follow the larger herbivores, such as <span>plains zebras</span> and <span>blue wildebeests</span> as they mow down the tall grasses. Then, the gazelles spread out more. In the wild, Thomson's gazelles can live 10-15 years. Their major predators are <span>cheetahs</span>, which are able to attain higher speeds, but gazelles can outlast them in long chases and are able to make turns more speedily. This small antelope-gazelle can run extremely fast, from 80 km/h (50 mph), to 96 km/h (60 mph) and zigzag, a peculiarity which often saves it from predators. Sometimes they are also chased by <span>leopards</span>, <span>lions</span> and <span>hyenas</span>, but the gazelles are faster and more agile; these predators attack especially the young or infirm individuals. They can also be devoured by <span>crocodiles</span> and <span>pythons</span>, and their fawns are sometimes the prey of <span>eagles</span>, <span>jackals</span>, and <span>baboons</span>.

<p>The red-collared widowbird has one of the highest measured <span>plumage</span> <span>carotenoid</span> concentrations in birds. There is a high presence of <span>lutein</span> and <span>zeaxanthin</span> in the feathers, which is consistent with their high dietary consumption of grass seeds. There is a carotenoid basis of &#x2018;redness&#x2019; observed in the bird, and studies suggest that its color production is due to enzymatic conversion of dietary pigments into red keto-carotenoids, a costly process. The red collar functions as a dominance signal, which was supported experimentally through manipulation of the badges. The experiment showed that red-collared males dominated orange males, which in turn dominated brown and blue collared males. Furthermore, with additional manipulation of badges, males with enlarged red, enlarged orange, and reduced red collars obtained territories, while those with reduced orange and blackened or removed collars failed to establish or maintain territories. Lastly, males with reduced signals defended smaller territories, had more intruders, and spent more time, thus increased cost, on aggressive interactions.

The tail length itself is the strongest predictor of mating success. However, when the tails were experimentally manipulated, comparing a shortened tail to the control, these males had equal success in acquiring territory with no difference in size or quality.

<p>The peregrine falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation in which to lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of <span>Australia</span> and on the west coast of Northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.</p>

This theory was eventually rejected, and scientists now believe the giraffe's neck arose through Darwinian <span>natural selection</span>&#x2014;that ancestral giraffes with long necks thereby had a competitive advantage that better enabled them to reproduce and pass on their genes.</p>

<p>Fully grown giraffes stand 5-6 m (16-20 ft) tall, with males taller than females. The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female with maximum weights of 1,930 kg (4,250 lb) and 1,180 kg (2,600 lb) having been recorded for males and females respectively.  Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short. Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height. Giraffes see in color and their senses of hearing and <span>smell</span> are also sharp. The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants. The giraffe's <span>prehensile</span> tongue is about 50 cm (20 in) long. It is purplish-black in color, perhaps to protect against sunburn, and is useful for grasping foliage, as well as for grooming and cleaning the animal's nose. The upper lip of the giraffe is also prehensile and useful when foraging. The lips, tongue, and inside of the mouth are covered in <span>papillae</span> to protect against thorns.</p>

<p>Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving "waistlines" to trees that are too tall. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.</p>

<p>Giraffe <span>gestation</span> lasts 400-460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions. The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the <span>fetal membranes</span>, and falls to the ground, severing the <span>umbilical cord</span>. The mother then grooms the newborn and helps it stand up. A newborn giraffe is about 1.8 m (6 ft) tall. Within a few hours of birth, the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one-week-old. However, for the first 1-3 weeks, it spends most of its time hiding; its coat pattern providing camouflage. The ossicones, which have lain flat while it was in the womb, become erect within a few days.</p>

<p>Live prey is sometimes attacked by the bearded vulture, with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture. Among these, <span>tortoises</span> seem to be especially favored depending on their local abundance. Tortoises predated may be nearly as heavy as the predating vulture. When killing tortoise, bearded vultures also fly to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles' hard shells. Golden eagles have been observed to kill tortoises in the same way. Other live animals, up to nearly their own size, been observed to be predaceously seized and dropped in flight. Among these are <span>rock hyraxes</span>, <span>hares</span>, <span>marmots</span> and, in one case, a 62 cm (24 in) long <span>monitor lizard</span>. Larger animals have been known to be attacked by bearded vultures, including <span>ibex</span>, <span>Capra goats</span>, <span>Chamois</span> and <span>Steenbok</span>. These animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths, although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other. Many large animals killed by bearded vultures are unsteady young, have appeared sickly or are obviously injured. Humans have been anecdotally reported to have been killed in the same way. However, this is unconfirmed and, if it does happen, most biologists who have studied the birds generally agreed it would be accidental on the part of the vulture. Occasionally smaller ground-dwelling birds, such as <span>partridges</span> and <span>pigeons</span>, have been reported eaten, possibly either as fresh carrion (which is usually ignored by these birds) or killed with beating wings by the vulture. While foraging for bones or live prey while in flight, bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground, staying around 2 to 4 m (6.6 to 13.1 ft) high. Occasionally, breeding pairs may forage and hunt together. In the <span>Ethiopian Highlands</span>, bearded vultures have adapted to living largely off human refuse.</p>

using('hyaena hyaena')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Striped hyenas were hunted by Ancient Egyptian peasants for duty and amusement along with other animals that were a threat to crops and livestock. <span>Algerian</span> hunters historically considered the killing of striped hyenas as beneath their dignity, due to the animal's reputation for cowardice. A similar attitude was held by British sportsmen in <span>British India</span>. Although striped hyenas are capable of quickly killing a dog with a single bite, they usually <span>feign death</span> when escape from hunting dogs is impossible, and will remain in this state for long periods, even when badly bitten. On some rare occasions, hyenas were ridden down and speared by men on horseback. Although hyenas were generally not fast enough to outrun horses, they had the habit of doubling and turning frequently during chases, thus ensuring long pursuits. Generally though, hyenas were hunted more as pests than sporting quarries; their scavenging damages skulls, skins and other articles from hunter's camps, which made them unpopular among sportsmen. In the <span>Soviet Union</span>, hyena hunting was not specially organised. Most hyenas were caught incidentally in traps meant for other animals. Some hunters in southern <span>Punjab</span>, <span>Kandahar</span> and <span>Quetta</span>, catch striped hyenas to use them in <span>hyena-baiting</span>. The hyenas are pitted against specially trained dogs, and are restrained with ropes in order to pull them away from the dogs if necessary. In Kandahar, hunters locally called <i>payloch</i> (naked foot) hunt striped hyenas by entering their dens naked with a noose in hand. When the hyena is cornered at the end of its lair, the hunter murmurs the magic formula &#x201C;turn into dust, turn into stone,&#x201D; which causes the animal to enter a hypnotic state of total submission, by which point the hunter can slip a noose over its forelegs and, finally, drag it out of the cave. A similar method was once practised by <span>Mesopotamian</span> <span>Arab</span> hunters, who would enter hyena dens and "flatter" the animal, which they believed could understand <span>Arabic</span>. The hunter would murmur "You are very nice and pretty and quite like a lion ; indeed, you are a lion". The hyena would then allow the hunter to place a noose around its neck and pose no resistance on being dragged out of its lair.</p>

using('kobus kob')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The social and reproductive organization of kob can vary. When in average or low population densities, males establish conventional <span>territories</span> and do not travel much. Adult males try to establish their territories in the best habitat available, which are inhabited by herds of females and their young. Herds are fluid and change in size and structure as individuals travel to find green vegetation. Nonterritorial males, particularly young males, live in bachelor herds and are segregated from the females by the territorial males. On <span>floodplains</span>, where kob are densely populated, around two-thirds of the territorial males establish traditional territories, while the rest live in clustered territories known as <span>leks</span>. These clusters are sometimes smaller than a single traditional territory. Lek clusters are located on patches of short grass or bare ground within comparably tall grassland. As such, these territories have little to no value other than to the males that reside in them. About eight or 9 of every 10 females visit leks to mate, trading spacing and food for mating success. Females and bachelor males live in large herds of up to 2000 and move through the leks, which are surrounded by high-quailty grass and are near waterholes and commonly traveled routes.</p>

<p>When hunting in shallower waters in New Zealand and Argentina, dusky dolphins tend to forage during the day. The dolphins chase schools of fish or squid and herd them into stationary balls.

During these times, dusky dolphins are believed to increase prey availability for other predators, including other dolphins, <span>seabirds</span>, <span>sharks</span>, and <span>pinnipeds</span>. In Argentina, dusky dolphins may use bird aggregations to locate and herd prey. Conversely, pinnipeds and sharks <span>take advantage</span> of the dolphin hunts.

<p>The lesser grey shrike hunts from a strategic post, wire or branch and primarily feeds on insects which it catches in the air or on the ground. The diet includes beetles, moths and butterflies, large flies, grasshoppers, crickets and millipedes. Some fruits such as cherries and figs are eaten to a limited extent. The bird occasionally impales freshly caught prey on thorns for use later, but this is done to a much lesser extent than by some other shrike species. It has been shown experimentally that this species only creates a larder when it is satiated and that prey items are seldom plentiful enough for this to be the case. The male has been observed to feed the female before starting to create a food store. Repeated experimental exposure of birds to a food surplus significantly increases the rate at which they impale freshly caught prey. Other causal factors in the failure of this species to hoard may be a shortage of suitable caching sites and the fact that the bird lacks practice in storing food and this constrains its learning ability.</p>

<p>As part of its adaptations for hunting in the savannas, the serval boasts long legs (the longest of all cats, relative to body size) for jumping, which also help it achieve a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), and has large ears with acute hearing. Its long legs and neck allow the serval to see over tall grasses, while its ears are used to detect prey, even those burrowing underground. They have been known to dig into burrows in search of underground prey, and to leap 2 to 3 m (7 to 10 ft) into the air to grab birds in flight. While hunting, the serval may pause for up to 15 minutes at a time to listen with eyes closed. Its pounce is a distinctive and precise vertical 'hop', which may be an adaptation for capturing flushed birds. It is able to leap up to 3.6 m (12 ft) horizontally from a stationary position, landing precisely on target with sufficient force to stun or kill its prey upon impact. The serval is an efficient killer, catching prey on an average of 50% of attempts, compared to an average of 38% for leopards and 30% for lions.</p>

The gerenuk is easily recognizable from its distinctive long and skinny neck which can be elongated further if need be for activities like feeding off the taller brambles and undergrowth of the desert. It also has remarkably long slender legs which are another great advantage as they can gallop away into the distance at very high speeds from any form of predator trying to attack. However, because of the extreme length of their legs, they can be more liable to fracture of the leg bone. There have been numerous occasions in which gerenuks actually snapped their long legs due to tripping and stumbling along the ground. From head to tail, the gerenuk is around 150 centimetres (59 in) long. Males are a little taller than females, at 89-105 cm (35-41 in) tall, with the females typically 80-100 cm (31-39 in) tall. The male is also heavier than the female, weighing 45 kilograms (99 lb), while females weigh around 30 kg (66 lb).

<p>The breeding season of black kites in India begins in winter, the young birds fledging before the <span>monsoons</span>. The nest is a rough platform of twigs and rags placed in a tree. Nest sites may be reused in subsequent years. European birds breed in summer. Birds in the Italian Alps tended to build their nest close to water in steep cliffs or tall trees. Nest orientation may be related to wind and rainfall. The nests may sometimes be decorated with bright materials such as white plastic and a study in Spain suggests that they may have a role in signalling to keep away other kites. After pairing, the male frequently copulates with the female. Unguarded females may be approached by other males, and extra pair copulations are frequent. Males returning from a foraging trip will frequently copulate on return, as this increases the chances of his sperm fertilizing the eggs rather than a different male. Both the male and female take part in nest building, incubation and care of chicks. The typical clutch size is 2 or sometimes 3 eggs. The incubation period varies from 30-34 days. Chicks of the Indian population stayed at the nest for nearly two months. Chicks hatched later in European populations appeared to fledge faster. The care of young by the parents also rapidly decreased with the need for adults to migrate. Siblings show aggression to each other and often the weaker chick may be killed, but parent birds were found to preferentially feed the smaller chicks in experimentally altered nests. Newly hatched young have down (prepennae) which are sepia on the back and black around the eye and buff on the head, neck and underparts. This is replaced by brownish gray second down (preplumulae). After 9 to 12 days the second down appears on the whole body except the top of the head. Body feathers begin to appear after 18 to 22 days. The feathers on the head become noticeable from the 24th to 29th day. The nestlings initially feed on food fallen at the bottom of the nest and begin to tear flesh after 33-39 days. They are able to stand on their legs after 17-19 days and begin flapping their wings after 27-31 days. After 50 days they begin to move to branches next to the nest. Birds are able to breed after their second year. Parent birds guard their nest and will dive aggressively at intruders. Humans who intrude the nest appear to be recognized by birds and singled out for dive attacks.</p>

<p>The southern elephant seal is distinguished from the <span>northern elephant seal</span> (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter <span>proboscis</span>. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to their tendency to bend their backs more strongly than the northern species. This seal shows extreme <span>sexual dimorphism</span> in size, possibly the largest of any mammal, with the males typically five to six times heavier than the females. While the females typically weigh 400 to 900 kg (880 to 1,980 lb) and measure 2.6 to 3 m (8.5 to 9.8 ft) long, the bulls typically weigh 2,200 to 4,000 kg (4,900 to 8,800 lb) and measure 4.2 to 5.8 m (14 to 19 ft) long. An adult female averages 771 kg (1,700 lb) in mass, while a mature bull averages about 3,175 kg (7,000 lb). Studies have indicated elephant seals from <span>South Georgia</span> are around 30% heavier and 10% longer on average than those from <span>Macquarie Island</span>. The record-sized bull, shot in Possession Bay, <span>South Georgia</span>, on 28 February 1913, measured 6.85 m (22.5 ft) long and was estimated to weigh 5,000 kg (11,000 lb). The maximum size of a female is 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) and 3.7 m (12 ft). The eyes are large, round, and black. The width of the eyes, and a high concentration of low-light pigments, suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have hind limbs whose ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the "feet" can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile dual palm is used to propel water. The <span>pectoral</span> fins are used little while swimming. While their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly (as fast as 8 km/h (5.0 mph)) in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, to catch up with a female, or to chase an intruder.</p>

<p>They feed primarily on plankton, including <span>euphausiids</span>, <span>copepods</span>, and a form of <span>amphipod</span> that is parasitic to jellyfish gonadal pouches. They also feed to a large extent on <span>myctophids</span> (lantern fish) which only occur at the surface at night in water over the continental slope. Individuals have been observed to feed at distances up to 300 km from any known breeding colony. Breeding individuals store energy rich lipids in a sac anterior to their stomach which are used to either sustain themselves while incubating their single egg, to feed their chick, or can also be used as a defensive mechanism when caught by a predator as do many other Procellariformes. There is evidence showing that parents feed their chicks different prey species than they consume themselves. Parent birds also accidentally feed their chicks plastic debris which they mistake for food items floating on the surface of the ocean. Chicks grow to a prefledging weight almost double of that when they actually fledge from the burrow in late September. Fall storms can cause these young fledging individuals to wreck on the mainland.</p>

<p>A typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, and a white patch above and behind the eye. Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint, which fades to white. It has a heavy and robust body with a large dorsal fin up to 2 m (6.6 ft) tall. Behind the fin, it has a dark grey "saddle patch" across the back. Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other <span>cetacean</span> species, such as the <span>false killer whale</span> or <span>Risso's dolphin</span>. The killer whale's teeth are very strong and covered in <span>enamel</span>. Its jaws are a powerful gripping apparatus, as the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.</p>

<p>The public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale-keeping in aquaria. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in killer whales has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film <i><span>Free Willy</span></i>, the movie's captive star <span>Keiko</span> was returned to the coast of his native <span>Iceland</span> in 1998. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the <span>Earth Island Institute</span>, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. In 2002 the orphan <span>Springer</span> was discovered in <span>Puget Sound</span>, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behavior and social structure of the region's killer whales. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young killer whale named <span>Luna</span>, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.</p>

<p>Chimpanzees have been described as highly territorial and are known to kill other chimps, although Margaret Power wrote in her 1991 book <i>The Egalitarians</i> that the field studies from which the aggressive data came, Gombe and Mahale, use artificial feeding systems that increased aggression in the chimpanzee populations studied, so might not reflect innate characteristics of the species as a whole. In the years following her artificial feeding conditions at Gombe, Jane Goodall described groups of male chimps patrolling the borders of their territory brutally attacking chimps which had split off from the Gombe group. A study published in 2010 found that the chimpanzees wage wars over land, not mates. Patrol parties from smaller groups are more likely to avoid contact with their neighbors. Patrol parties from large groups will even take over a smaller group's territory, gaining access to more resources, food and females.</p>

Its alternate name comes from the <span>Egyptian</span> god <span>Anubis</span>, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back. Besides the mane, the male olive baboon differs from the female in terms of size and weight and canine tooth size; males are, on average, 70 cm (28 in) tall while standing and females measure 60 cm (24 in) in height.

<p>At Payne's study locality the breeding season of the chestnut sparrow lagged behind that of its host. The sparrows began courting when the weavers started constructing their elaborate nests. Once the breeding season began, "the first impression was of the sparrows nesting and the grey-capped social weavers unobtrusively skulking nearby". Males displayed around the new weaver nests, crouching, raising and quivering their wings in a shallow V, and giving a high, twittering trill. The males were chased by the social-weavers, but returned persistently, until joined by females. When a female came near a displaying male, the male would increase his rate of wing quivering, spread and depress his tail, and bow down his head, until his body formed an arc. This exaggerated display may be an adaptation related to pair formation in the absence of male nest-building, and it may also serve to focus attention in breeding colonies and keep the birds in a colony together, as colonies are in clumps of trees surrounded by similar habitat. During Payne's study, copulation was seen only in the acacias, around the social-weaver nests. Females would fly to displaying males and solicit copulation in typical sparrow fashion, crouching, quivering, and drooping their wings. When males saw displaying females, they would fly to them and mount them immediately. Males continued their wing quivering during copulation, and females would crouch, quiver, raise their head, and hold their tails horizontally. After a copulation the female would fly off and the male would continue displaying. During this courtship and afterwards, males and mated pairs would interfere with the social-weavers' nest building, until they drove the social-weavers out. During Payne's study period, "Chases and fights between the two species were seen nearly every minute of observation", and the male sparrows spent about a fifth of their day annoying the social-weavers. Little is recorded of incubation and fledging periods in the wild. In captivity the incubation period lasts for 18 to 19 days. <span>Clutches</span> typically contain three or four eggs, which are ovular, mostly coloured white or bluish-white.

<p>Sociable weavers construct permanent nests on trees and other tall objects. These nests are the largest built by any bird, and are large enough to house over a hundred pairs of birds, containing several generations at a time. The nests are highly structured and provide birds with a more advantageous temperature relative to the outside. The central chambers retain heat and are used for nighttime roosting. The outer rooms are used for daytime shade and maintain temperatures of 7-8 degrees Celsius inside while outside temperatures may range from 16-33 degrees Celsius. Sociable weaver nests are used <span>commensally</span> by several other bird species, most commonly the <span>pygmy falcon</span>.

using('philomachus pugnax')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Satellite males, about 16% of the total number, have white or mottled ruffs and do not occupy territories; they enter leks and attempt to mate with the females visiting the territories occupied by the resident males. Resident males tolerate the satellite birds because, although they are competitors for mating with the females, the presence of both types of male on a territory attracts additional females. Females also prefer larger leks, and leks surrounded by taller plants, which give better nesting habitat.</p>

<p>The nest is a shallow ground scrape lined with grass leaves and stems, and concealed in marsh plants or tall grass up to 400 m (400 yd) from the lek. Nesting is solitary, although several females may lay in the general vicinity of a lek. The eggs are slightly glossy, green or olive, and marked with dark blotches; they are laid from mid-March to early June depending on latitude.</p>

Most of the plumage is pinkish white. The clearest difference between this species and the <span>greater flamingo</span>, the only other Old World species of flamingo, is the much more extensive black on the bill.

<p>The common chiffchaff breeds across Europe and Asia east to eastern <span>Siberia</span> and north to about 70&#xB0;N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western <span>Turkey</span> and northwestern <span>Iran</span>. It is migratory, but it is one of the first <span>passerine</span> <span>birds</span> to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5 metres (16 ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, <span>bracken</span>, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the <span>willow warbler</span> (<i>P. trochilus</i>) prefers younger trees, while the <span>wood warbler</span> (<i>P. sibilatrix</i>) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern <span>England</span> and the mild urban <span>microclimate</span> of <span>London</span>.

<p>Sperm whales usually dive between 300 to 800 metres (980 to 2,620 ft), and sometimes 1-2 kilometres (3,300-6,600 ft) to search for food. Such dives can last more than an hour. They feed on several species, notably the <span>giant squid</span>, but also the larger <span>colossal squid</span>, <span>octopuses</span>, and diverse fish like <span>demersal</span> <span>rays</span>, but the main part of their diet consists of medium-sized <span>squid</span>.

Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans; however white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid. One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting <span>Humboldt squid</span>.

The mane is raised during confrontations in order to make the aardwolves appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have. It's lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip. The aardwolf is about 55 to 80 centimetres (22 to 31 in) long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about 20-30 centimetres (7.9-11.8 in) long, and stands about 40 to 50 centimetres (16 to 20 in) tall at the shoulders. An adult aardwolf weighs approximately 7-10 kilograms (15-22 lb), sometimes reaching 15 kilograms (33 lb). The aardwolfs in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about 10 kilograms (22 lb)), whereas the eastern version weighs more (around 14 kilograms (31 lb)). The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena. The teeth and skull are similar to those of the hyena, though smaller, and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. It does still have canines; however unlike the hyena, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense. Its ears, which are large, are very similar to the <span>Striped Hyena</span>.</p>

Like all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh on average 2.2-3.5 kg (4.9-7.7 lb) and are 60-70 cm (24-28 in) tall. It has distinctive pink patches of skin above the eyes and a black facial mask; the body upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band. This pink gland above their eyes helps them to cope with changing temperatures. When the temperature gets hotter, the body of the African penguin sends more blood to these glands to be cooled by the air surrounding it. This then causes the gland to turn a darker shade of pink.</p>

<p>African penguins grow to 60-70 cm (24-28 in) tall and weigh between 2.2-3.5 kg (4.9-7.7 lb). They have a black stripe and black spots on the chest, the pattern of spots being unique for every penguin, like human fingerprints. They have pink glands above their eyes, which are used for <span>thermoregulation</span>. The hotter the penguin gets, the more blood is sent to these glands so it may be cooled by the surrounding air, thus making the glands more pink. This species exhibits slight <span>sexual dimorphism</span>: the males are larger than the females and have larger beaks. Juveniles do not possess the bold, delineated markings of the adult but instead have dark upperparts that vary from greyish-blue to brown; the pale underparts lack both spots and the band. The beak is more pointed than that of the <span>Humboldt</span>. Their distinctive black and white colouring is a vital form of camouflage called <span>countershading</span>- white for underwater predators looking upwards and black for predators looking down onto the dark water. African penguins look similar and are thought to be related to the Humboldt, Magellanic, and Galapagos penguins. African penguins have a very recognizable appearance with a thick band of black that is in the shape of an upside-down horseshoe. They have black feet and unique black spots that vary in size and shape per penguin. Magellanic penguins share a similar characteristic that often confuses the two, the similarity is a double bar on the throat and chest.

The Crowned Eagle may be found from an altitude of sea-level to at least 3,000 m (9,800 ft). Owing to lack of current suitable habitat, the eagle's range is often somewhat discontinuous. In the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, the Crowned Eagle has been confirmed to survive at relatively high densities in protected areas that maintain dense, old-growth rainforests. In <span>Kenya</span>, 84% of the Crowned Eagles range in within rainforest with an annual rainfall amount of more than 150 cm (59 in). Around stretches of <span>East Africa</span> where protected areas mostly consist of fairly open habitat, Crowned Eagles usually live in wooded areas of rocky hills and narrow riverine strips, only rarely ranging into savanna surrounding the hills. <span>Southern Africa</span> has been subject to the most comprehensive study of Crowned Eagle habitat, largely since many areas there would seem inhospitable to a large raptor often associated with old-growth forest. In southern Africa, its distribution south of the <span>Limpopo River</span> coincides largely with <span>montane forest</span>, although it is not restricted to that habitat and may range secondarily into <span>plantations</span>, usually of <span>eucalyptus</span>.

All <span>mangabeys</span> and most <span>colobus monkeys</span> weigh considerably in excess of 5 kg (11 lb) at maturity. Any monkey of a weight of up to 10 to 15 kg (22 to 33 lb) may be reportedly be hunted. As a comparison, the heaviest primate known to be successfully killed by Harpy Eagles was a 6.5 kg (14 lb) <span>Bolivian red howler</span> (<i>Alouatta sara</i>). The Crowned Eagle&#x2019;s diet may extend to the young or even (rarely) adult females of <span>baboons</span> and similar species, as adult female <span>Yellow Baboons</span>, <span>Olive Baboons</span> (<i>Papio anubis</i>), <span>Chacma Baboons</span> (<i>P. ursinus</i>), <span>Drills</span> (<i>Mandrillus leucophaeus</i>) and <span>Mandrills</span> (<i>M. sphinx</i>), all falling into the above maximum primate weight bracket, have been successfully hunted. In some cases baboons and drills may be actively avoided, as the adult males of these species, at up to twice as heavy as the female, are probably invulnerable to hunting and tend to be notoriously violent-tempered. In one case, Olive Baboons destroyed the nest of a Crowned Eagle pair after one of the eagles killed a baby in the baboon group. When experimentally exposed to an image of a Crowned Eagle, a dominant male Mandrill reacted aggressively towards it, implying that they will keep eagles at bay to protect the more vulnerable members of their troop. The Crowned Eagle is considered a potential predator of infant <span>Chimpanzees</span> (<i>Pan troglodytes</i>) and <span>Bonobos</span> (<i>P. pansicus</i>), although this is unconfirmed. Although rarely observed, some monkeys will &#x201C;bait&#x201D; Crowned Eagles, that is harass and provoke them. Leslie Brown described <span>Sykes' monkeys</span> (<i>Cercopithecus albogularis</i>) as rarely baiting eagles &#x201C;with the insolent impunity of an expert <span>tolero</span> with a <span>bull</span>&#x201D;. Struhsaker and Leakey found that adult male monkeys were often better represented in the diet than adult females. This may be a result of the behavior of male primates. In some species, only adult males often travel separately from social groups, only adult males take aggressive action against eagles, and only adult males have loud calls that may attract the attention of eagles. The variation in behavior of primates is illustrated that in <span>red colobus species</span>, in which adult males patrol in mixed groups, the males are rarely attacked; meanwhile in the <span>black-and-white colobus species</span>, in which adult males often patrol alone, male are regularly attacked and killed by Crowned Eagles. However, adult monkeys (52%) were found in almost equal measure as juvenile monkeys (at 48%) in Uganda. African primates weighing under 2 kg (4.4 lb), are almost entirely arboreal and nocturnal. However, such primates, actually allies of <span>lemurs</span> rather than <span>monkeys</span>, may occasionally also be hunted by Crowned Eagles. <span>Potto</span> (<i>Perodicticus potto</i>) are notable secondary prey in the Tai Forest and various <span>galagos</span> have been found across the range, such as in the <span>Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve</span> where they made up 7.5% of the remains. Although no one has seen the eagles catch these primates, it is thought potoos and galagos are likely to be assaulted if discovered by an eagle while sleeping in dense <span>foliage</span> during the day.</p>

<p>After engaging in the breeding display described above, the pair collaborate in building a massive nest in a fork of a large forest tree, typically from 12 to 45 m (39 to 148 ft) above the ground. While the female fetches more nesting material, the male tends to be more active in nest construction. In <span>East Africa</span>, many nests appear to be close to a forest river. Generally, Crowned Eagles seem to be attracted to the taller trees in the forest. On the <span>Nyika Plateau</span> in <span>Malawi</span>, the favorite nesting trees are the large emergent <i><span>Aningeria adolfi-friedericii</span></i> and <i><span>Chrysophyllum gorungosanum</span></i>, and a pair in the Lower Shire used a <i><span>Sterculia appendiculata</span></i> tree. In <span>Zimbabwe</span>, <i><span>Newtonia buchananii</span></i> are reportedly one of the most used tree species for nesting. Exceptional Crowned Eagle nests have been observed on sheer cliff faces. In southern Africa, the species nest in drier and denuded terrain than expected such as <i><span>Adansonia</span></i> stands on semi-arid hillsides. Despite the relative sparseness of this habitat, these sites have a varied and convoluted terrain, with nooks and crannies, valleys, overhangs and hideaways that allow a Crowned Eagle to exercise its particular hunting skills. In Kenya, similar fractured landscapes can also be utilized by Crowned Eagles, such as the black gigantic volcanic rubble fields of <span>Tsavo West National Park</span>, the lower <span>Chyulu Hills</span>, <span>Kibwezi</span> and <span>Soysambu Conservancy</span>. These are jungles of boulders covered with low growth interspersed (in the past) with high trees. A nest built from scratch may take up to 5 months to construct, however existing nests are often repaired and re-used during successive breeding seasons, a process that can take as much as 3 months. It is typical for an eagle pair to use a nest for more than five years and, unlike several other booted eagles, Crowned Eagle pairs rarely build more than one nest for alternate use. Most large eagles build a very large nest and the Crowned Eagle is no exception, as it builds one of the largest nests of any eagle. In the first year they build a nest, it may measure 1.5 m (4.9 ft) across and 50 cm (20 in) deep. However, a larger nest, usually after several years of usage, may measure up to 2.5 m (8.2 ft) across and up to 3 m (9.8 ft) deep. The nest may consists of both dead and greener branches and have a light coverage of leaves and animal matter. Copulation takes place in the nest, several times a day. Reportedly copulation can occur up to a year before laying, although these may be exceptional cases of mating for non-fertilization purposes (which, in other eagles, has been thought to be related mainly to strengthening pair bonds). A pre-copulation display typically occurs, wherein the male runs repeatedly around the crouching female with wings upraised, which displays the chestnut of the under-wing coverts and beautiful barring.</p>

<p>In South Africa the Crowned Eagle lays its eggs from September to October; in <span>Rhodesia</span>, it lays from May to October; mainly near October around the <span>Congo River</span>; anywhere from June to November in <span>Kenya</span>, with a peak in August through October; in Uganda from December to July; and in <span>West Africa</span>, laying peaks in October. The clutch of the Crowned Eagle either contains 1 or 2 eggs. Often in <span>East Africa</span>, just one egg is laid. Eggs are usually just white, though may sometimes be overlaid with sparse red-brown markings. The eggs are moderate in size, averaging 68.2 mm &#xD7; 53.6 mm (2.69 in &#xD7; 2.11 in), with ranges of 60.9-75.5 mm (2.40-2.97 in) in length and 50.8-57.9 mm (2.00-2.28 in) in width. When a natural disaster befalls a nest, a replacement may be made in 2 months time. Incubation lasts for approximately 49 days. 80-90% of egg incubation is done by the female during the day. Food is mainly brought to the nest by the male in the early stages of breeding, though sometimes both sexes may deliver food. Male brings food to the incubating female every 3 to 5 days. When they initially hatch, the young tend to be quite quiet. If two eggs are laid, the younger one dies by starvation after being outcompeted for food by the older one or even directly killed by its older sibling. No nest of wild Crowned Eagles has been known to successfully produce more than one fledgling, though in captivity two have been known to survive with human interference (supplementally feeding the younger chick or taking it out of the nest). In cases where the older nestling dies, the younger one may be fed more regularly and survive.</p>

using('stephanoaetus coronatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>After hatching, the male kill rate rises to one kill every 1.5 days. Pair behavior while raising chicks is very variable, some males are very attentive to their young, while others leave virtually all brooding to the female. After 40 days of age, the young is capable of feeding itself, though is often still fed. The first feathers through the white down emerge when the Crowned Eagle chick is 40 days old, with the feathers ultimately covering the down in 76 days. After 76 days, the main feather development is in the tail or the wings. Wing-flapping begins at 45 to 50 days, increasing after around 75 days. The young fledge at 90 to 115 days, with an average 110.6 days and any period of time less than 100 days is considered unusually soon. On average, male chicks tend to be more active wing-flappers and usually will first fly around 10 days earlier than the more phlegmatic female chicks. After fledging, females are attentive 95% of the day and brood 50-75% of the day, the amount decreasing slightly with each day. The female does much of the prey capture and a majority of the nest defense after the young fledge. After fledging, the young remain in the neighborhood of the parent&#x2019;s nest and are feed every 3 to 5 days by either parent for their first 270-350 days of life. The rate of food-delivery varies from several times a day to every 3 days on average during the post-fledging period. The fledged juvenile will solicit adults (apparently even unrelated adults) for prey but does not actually take the prey unless this occurs around the nest site. The first recorded kill for a young Crowned occurred 61 days after fledging, although this is considered exceptionally early by the standards of this species. Flights increase incrementally through the post-fledging period, although the young do not engage in rising flights until they are fully independent. Independence seems triggered by the increased indifference of parents to bringing food. Due to the loud vocal interplay between the parents and the fledging eagle, the adults seem to take it as a sign that their offspring has sought independence if they return to the nesting area and hear no right auditory response. The young eagle usually remains in the care of its parents for a total of up to 11 months after it fledges, longer than is known in almost any other raptor. The advantage of this prolonged stretch to independence is that it may make for a stronger young eagle when compared to other accipitrids which have almost no post-fledging dependency period. In 34 possible cases, 18 resulted in eggs being laid. Fledging success is approximately 83% and almost all young that leave the nest also reach independence. Early estimates that it takes up to 20 years for this species to reach adulthood are, of course, erroneous and it is estimated that most Crowned Eagles will reach breeding maturity at around five years old, as is typical for large eagles.</p>

<p>While several smaller raptorial birds will attack humans if they come too close to the nesting site, usually these have minor consequences for the human victim. Mother Crowned Eagles, in the post-fledging stage, readily attack any human who comes close to the nest; adult males may also attack humans before fledging but only do so rarely. Despite the size and power of the <span>eagle</span>, attacks by the eagles may have minor consequences as well since the attacks are meant only to displace and not kill or seriously maim the intruding animal. However, nest-defense attacks may nonetheless possibly result in deep, painful, open wounds, which can lead to risk of infection or the need for stitches. Reportedly, injury such an attack can be prevented by jabbing the eagle gently with a large stick. The Crowned Eagle is perhaps the only extant raptorial bird which has been believed to attack human children as prey. In one case, a 7-year old boy, of a weight of approximately 20 kg (44 lb), was ambushed by a Crowned Eagle, who gouged its talons through the boy&#x2019;s throat and chest. The attack was ended by a woman who came upon them and rescued the child by bludgeoning the eagle to death with a hoe. In another case, the skull of a human child was found in the nest of a Crowned Eagle pair. In yet another instance, when assisting in the investigation of the disappearance of a four-year-old girl, Simon Thomsett came to believe she was the victim of a Crowned Eagle after the severed arm of a child was found in a tall tree that was inaccessible to leopards and known to be used as a Crowned Eagle cache. One other living eagle, the <span>White-tailed Eagle</span> (<i>Haliaeetus albicilla</i>), has been confirmed to take a human child in an isolated, possible predation attempt, a four-year-old girl in <span>Sweden</span>. Unlike in Crowned Eagle attacks, the White-tailed Eagle actually carried off the little girl in flight to its eyrie but the child escaped unharmed after having been by the eagle dropped to a ledge 16 m (52 ft) below the nest. In the famed <span>Taung</span> deposit in South Africa, a skull from a child <i><span>Australopithecus africanus</span></i>, a possible ancestors of <span>human beings</span>, led to considerable speculation. Ultimately referred to as the <span>Taung Child</span> and estimated to weigh 9 to 11 kg (20 to 24 lb), the child became the type specimen for its species. The child appeared to have died from a clean row of piercing to its skull. Scholarly examination of the piercings has led scientists to believe that the specimen was seemingly killed by an eagle, of which the Crowned Eagle is the most likely candidate. This predatory relationship has led to much hypothesizing as to whether <i>Stephanoaetus</i> eagles may have partially shaped human evolution, due to small early primate ancestors having evolved towards larger body sizes and larger brains to reduce the probability of eagle predation.</p>

<p>The common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, nesting from the <span>taiga</span> of Asia to tropical shores, and at altitudes up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in Armenia, and 4,800 m (15,700 ft) in Asia. It avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind, and also icy waters, so it does not breed as far north as the Arctic tern. The common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat, including sand or <span>shingle beaches</span>, firm dune areas, <span>salt marsh</span>, or, most commonly, islands. Flat grassland or <span>heath</span>, or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment. In mixed colonies, common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than Arctic terns, but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns; the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species. Common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts, and may even nest on flat factory roofs. Unusual nest sites include hay bales, a stump 0.6 m (2.0 ft) above the water, and floating logs or vegetation. There is a record of a common tern taking over a <span>spotted sandpiper</span> nest and laying its eggs with those of the <span>wader</span>. Outside the breeding season, all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas, and somewhere to land.

Where other <i>Sylvia</i> warblers also breed, blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives, preferably those with a good canopy, such as <span>pedunculate oak</span>. In prime habitat, breeding densities reach 100-200 pairs per square kilometre (250-500 pairs per square mile) in northern Europe, and 500-900 pairs per square kilometre (1,250-2,250 pairs per square mile) in Italy.

<p>When male blackcaps return to their breeding areas, they establish a <span>territory</span>. Adults that have previously bred return to the site they have used in previous summers, whereas inexperienced birds either wander until they find a suitable area, or establish a very large initial territory which contracts under pressure from neighbours. Territorial boundaries are established initially by loud singing, performed while the male displays with his crown raised, tail fanned and slow wingbeats. This display is followed, if necessary, by a chase, often leading to a fight. The typical territory size in a French study was 1.12 ha (2.8 acres), but in insect-rich tall <span>maquis</span> in Gibraltar, the average was only 0.16 ha (0.4 acres).

As is common in the genus <i><span>Accipiter</span></i>, male black sparrowhawks are smaller than females. Typically the weights of males lie between 450 and 650 g (0.99 and 1.43 lb) as compared to females, which have weights in the range 750 to 980 g (1.65 to 2.16 lb). The typical total length is 40-54 cm (16-21 in). The legs are yellow. As in most <i>Accipiters</i>, the wings are relatively modest in size for such a large raptor, the <span>wing chord</span> measuring 25.1-34.4 cm (9.9-13.5 in) and the wingspan measuring 77-105 cm (30-41 in). The <span>tarsi</span> and <span>tail</span> are both relatively long, also typical <i>Accipiter</i> features, at 7.2-9 cm (2.8-3.5 in) and 19-27 cm (7.5-10.6 in), respectively. The features of the black sparrowhawk (and <i>Accipiters</i> in general) are reflective of the necessities that come with actively hunting in dense arboreal habitats, though this species can also hunt very efficiently in open areas.</p>

<p>There are 2 subspecies of the black sparrowhawks: <i>Accipiter melanoleucus melanoleucus</i>, which was named by A. Smith in 1830, and <i>Accipiter melanoleucus temminckii</i>, which was named by Hartlaub in 1855. As described in the next section, the 2 subspecies occur in different regions of Africa and both belong to the genus <i>Accipiter</i> in the <span>Accipitridae</span> family along with other well&#xAD;&#x2010;known members such as hawks and eagles, all of which are part of the <span>Falconiformes</span> order.</p>

using('accipiter melanoleucus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Both subspecies are only found in parts of Africa that are south of the Sahara desert; <i>A. m. temminckii</i> inhabit much of the northwest section such as <span>Senegal</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, and <span>Central African Republic</span>, while <i>A. m. melanoleucus</i> can be found starting from the northeast section down to <span>South Africa</span>. They naturally inhabit patches of forests, rich woodlands and riverine strips extending into dry bush areas. They can be found in many areas as long as they have large trees, including <span>mangroves</span> in coastal <span>Kenya</span>. especially in southern Africa, black sparrowhawks have adapted to stands of the non-&#xAD;indigenous <span>eucalypt</span>, <span>poplar</span>, and <span>pine</span>, all of which are grown commercially and are able to grow up to 15 m (49 ft) taller than native trees. Their adaptability to secondary forests and cultivations (they are not uncommon around homesteads now) is one of the reasons why they are not as greatly impacted by deforestation as many African forest birds and may actually increase populations where such stands have been placed in otherwise open country. They can be in elevation from sea-level to 3,700 m (12,100 ft).</p>

<p>Black sparrowhawks prey primarily on mid-sized birds. Most prey is spotted from a foliage-concealed perch and then is killed in flight while on a short flying dash. Less often, they stoop or chase prey seen during low or high flight over open country or near the canopy of trees and, in some cases, may even pursue prey on foot. Although kills are often made in under a minute after the initial attack, occasionally this species may engage in a prolonged pursuit over several minutes. They have been known to scan for antswarms so they can predate birds attracted to them. Most birds preyed on by this species are in the size range of 80-300 g (2.8-10.6 oz). However, they have taken <span>guineafowl</span> weighing up to 1.5 kg (3.3 lb). <span>Doves</span> are the primary prey of males, wheres females take a greater quantity of larger prey such as <span>pigeons</span> and <span>francolins</span>. With some regularity, they prey on other raptor species, including <span>shikra</span>, <span>Ovambo sparrowhawk</span>, <span>African goshawk</span> and <span>wood owl</span>. They often take species such as <span>rock pigeons</span> that have flourished due to urban growth and settlement. It is one of the few fortunate species that have been able to adapt to their changing habitat due to <span>afforestation</span> by taking advantage of the increase in dove and pigeon populations. They may also feed on poultry found in nearby villages, which have been inadvertently made available to them by humans. On occasion, they may supplement their diet with small <span>mammals</span>, such as <span>rodents</span> and juvenile <span>mongooses</span>. Black sparrowhawks can carry prey up to 12 km (7.5 mi), usually well above the canopy.</p>

<p>The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short, broad wings and a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. When females are larger than males, it is known as reverse <span>sexual dimorphism</span>; this is unusual in higher <span>vertebrates</span> but typical in <span>birds of prey</span>, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.</p>

<p>The Eurasian sparrowhawk's small bill is used for plucking feathers and pulling prey apart, rather than killing or cutting. Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds. The outer toe is <i>"fairly long and slender"</i>; the inner toe and back toe are relatively short and thick. The middle toe is very long and can be used to grasp objects, while a protuberance on the underside of the toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap, which helps with gripping.</p>

<p>The oldest known wild Eurasian sparrowhawk lived more than two decades; it was found dead in <span>Denmark</span> 20 years and 3 months after having been <span>ringed</span>. The typical lifespan is four years. Data analysis by the <span>British Trust for Ornithology</span> shows that the proportion of juveniles surviving their first year of life is 34%; adult survival from one year to the next is 69%. Birds in their first year of life weigh less than adults, and are especially light in the first two months after reaching independence. There is probably high mortality, especially for young males, during this time. A study in southern Scotland suggested that the greater mortality in young male birds may be due to their smaller size and the smaller size of their prey, which means that they can <i>"last less long between meals."</i> Their size also means that their range of prey is restricted. It has been estimated that a female Eurasian sparrowhawk of average weight could survive for seven days without feeding - three days longer than a male of average weight.</p>

<p>A widespread species throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the <span>Old World</span>, the Eurasian sparrowhawk is resident or breeds in an estimated global range of 23,600,000 km (9,100,000 miles) and had an estimated population of 1.5 million birds in 2009. Although global population trends have not been analysed, numbers seem to be stable, so it has been classified as being of <span>Least Concern</span> by <span>IUCN</span>. The race <i>granti</i>, with 100 pairs resident on <span>Madeira</span> and 200 pairs on the <span>Canary Islands</span>, is threatened by loss of habitat, <span>egg-collecting</span> and illegal hunting, and is listed on Annex I of the <span>European Commission</span> <span>Birds Directive</span>. It is one of the most common birds of prey in Europe, along with the <span>common kestrel</span> and <span>common buzzard</span>. The <span>Norwegian</span> and <span>Albanian</span> populations are declining and, in many parts of Europe, Eurasian sparrowhawks are still shot. However, this low-level persecution has not affected the populations badly. In the UK, the population increased by 108% between 1970-2005, but saw a 1% decline over 1994-2006.

<p>Small birds are killed on impact or when squeezed by the Eurasian sparrowhawk's foot, especially the two long claws. Victims which struggle are "kneaded" by the hawk, using its talons to squeeze and stab. When dealing with large prey species which peck and flap, the hawk's long legs help. It stands on top of its prey to pluck and pull it apart. The feathers are plucked and usually the breast muscles are eaten first. The bones are left, but can be broken using the notch in the bill. Like other birds of prey, Eurasian sparrowhawks produce <span>pellets</span> containing indigestible parts of their prey. These range from 25 to 35 mm (1.0-1.4 inches) long and 10-18 mm (0.4-0.7 inches) wide and are round at one end and more narrow and pointed at the other. They are usually composed of small feathers, as the larger ones are plucked and not consumed.</p>

<p>During hunting, this species can fly 2-3 km (1.2-1.9 miles) per day. It rises above tree level mostly to display, soar above territory and to make longer journeys. A study in a forested area of <span>Norway</span> found that the mean size of the home ranges was 9.2 km&#xB2; (3.5 miles&#xB2;) for males, and 12.3 km&#xB2; (4.7 miles&#xB2;) for females, which was larger than studies in <span>Great Britain</span> had found, <i>"probably due to lower land productivity and associated lower densities of prey species in the [Norwegian study area]"</i>.</p>

<p>The Eurasian sparrowhawk breeds in well-grown, extensive areas of woodland, often coniferous or mixed, preferring forest with a structure neither too dense nor too open, to allow a choice of flight paths. The <span>nest</span> can be located in the fork of a tree, often near the trunk and where two or three branches begin, on a horizontal branch in the lower canopy, or near the top of a tall shrub. If available, <span>conifers</span> are preferred. A new nest is built every year, generally close to the nest of the previous year, and sometimes using an old wood pigeon (<i>A. n. melaschistos</i> frequently uses the old nests of <span>Jungle Crows</span>) nest as a base; the male does most of the work. The structure, made of loose twigs up to 60 cm (2.0 ft) long, has an average diameter of 60 cm (24 in). When the <span>eggs</span> are laid, a lining of fine twigs or bark chippings is added.</p>

<p>Many studies, mostly short-term, failed to find an effect on songbird populations caused by predatory birds such as Eurasian sparrowhawks. But analysis of long-term, large-scale national data from the UK's Common Bird Census demonstrated that the declines in farmland songbird populations since the 1960s are unlikely to have been caused by increased predation by Eurasian sparrowhawks and magpies. The results of the study indicated that patterns of year-to-year songbird population change were the same at different sites, whether the predators were present or not. Another study, which examined the effects of predators - including the Eurasian sparrowhawk and <span>introduced</span> <span>grey squirrel</span> - on UK passerine populations, found that "<i>whilst a small number of associations may suggest significant negative effects between predator and prey species, for the majority of the songbird species examined there is no evidence that increases in common avian predators or grey squirrels are associated with large-scale population declines."</i></p>

Cheetahs are 66 to 94 cm (26 to 37 in) tall at the shoulder. Males tend to be slightly larger than females and have slightly bigger heads, but there is not a great variation in cheetah sizes and it is difficult to tell males and females apart by appearance alone.

<p>Male great reed warblers have been observed to communicate via two basic song types: short songs about one second in length with few syllables, and long songs of about four seconds that have more syllables and are louder than the short variety. It has been observed that long songs are primarily used by males to attract females; long songs are only given spontaneously by unpaired males, and cease with the arrival of a female. Short songs, however, are primarily used in territorial encounters with rival males.</p>

using('acrocephalus arundinaceus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]

<p>Traditionally, monogamous species of genus <i>Acrocephalus</i> use long, variable, and complex songs to attract mates, whereas polygynous varieties use short, simple, stereotypical songs for territorial defense. There is evidence that long songs have been evolved through intersexual selection, whereas short songs have been evolved through intrasexual selection. &#x201C;A. arundinaceus&#x201D; is a notable example of these selective pressures, as it is a partial polygynist and has evolved variable song structure (both long and short) through evolutionary compromise.</p>

<p>A long-term study of the factors that contribute to male <span>fitness</span> examined the characteristics of males and territories in relation to annual and lifetime breeding success. It showed that the arrival order of the male was the most significant factor for predicting pairing success, fledgling success, and number of offspring that survive. It also found that arrival order was closely correlated with territory attractiveness rank. Females seem to prefer early arriving males that occupy more attractive territories. These females also tend to gain direct benefits through the increased production of fledglings and <span>offspring</span> that become adults. In addition, male song repertoire length is positively correlated to annual harem size and overall lifetime production of offspring that survive. Song repertoire size alone is able to predict male lifetime number of surviving offspring. Females tend to be attracted to males with longer song repertoires since they tend to sire offspring with improved viability. In doing so, they gain indirect benefits for their own young.</p>

<p>Great Reed Warblers have a short, <span>polygynous</span> breeding cycle in which the male contributes little to parental care. They defend large territories in reed beds where there is reduced visibility, which may allow males to practice deception by moving and attracting a second female. This second female may not realize that the male has already mated. Polygyny of the Great Reed Warbler was assessed in another study that showed the importance of <span>female choice</span>. The differences in territory characteristics seemed to be more important. However, there is also a strong correlation between male and their territory characteristics. Models based on the polygyny threshold and sexy son hypotheses predict that females should gain evolutionary advantage in either short-term or long-term in this mating system, yet the study did not support this.

<p>The <b>impala</b> (<i>Aepyceros melampus</i>) is a medium-sized <span>African</span> <span>antelope</span>. It is the <span>type species</span> of the genus <i><span>Aepyceros</span></i> and belongs to the family <span>Bovidae</span>. It was first described by German zoologist <span>Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein</span> in 1812. Two <span>subspecies</span> of the impala have been recognised: the common impala (<i>A. m. melampus</i>) and the <span>black-faced</span> (<i>A. m. petersi</i>). They are typically between 120-160 cm (47-63 in) long. Males stand up to approximately 75-92 cm (30-36 in) at the shoulder and weigh 53-76 kg (117-168 lb), while females are 70-85 cm (28-33 in) and 40-53 kg (88-117 lb). Both are characterised by a glossy, reddish brown coat. Only the males have the characteristic slender, lyre-shaped <span>horns</span>, which can grow to be 45-92 cm (18-36 in) long.</p>

using('aepyceros melampus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The impala inhabits savanna grasslands and woodlands close to water sources. It is a mixed forager, whose diet consists of grasses, <span>forbs</span>, <span>monocots</span>, <span>dicots</span> and foliage. It switches between grazing and browsing depending on the season and habitat. Water is an essential requirement. Impala are fast runners and are known for their leaping ability, reaching heights up to 3 m (9.8 ft). They communicate using a variety of unique visual and vocal cues. There are three distinct social groups during the wet season: the female herds, the bachelor herds and the territorial males. The mating season is the three-week long period toward the end of the wet season in May. A single fawn is born after a gestational period of about six to seven months. The fawn remains with its mother for four to six months, after which it joins juvenile groups.</p>

<p>The <span>scientific name</span> of the impala is <i>Aepyceros melampus</i>. It is the <span>type species</span> of the genus <i><span>Aepyceros</span></i> and belongs to the family <span>Bovidae</span>. It was first described by German zoologist Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein in 1812. The vernacular name "impala" comes from the <span>Zulu language</span> meaning "<span>gazelle</span>". The scientific name is derived from <span>Greek</span> words &#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; <i>aipos</i> ("high"), &#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C2; <i>ceros</i> ("horn") and <i>melas</i> ("black"), <i>pous</i> ("foot").</p>

<p>It is a <span>sexually dimorphic</span> antelope; only males are horned, and they are noticeably larger than the females. The head-and-body length for the species as a whole is typically between 120-160 cm (47-63 in). Males reach approximately 75-92 cm (30-36 in) at the shoulder, while females reach 70-85 cm (28-33 in). Males typically weigh 53-76 kg (117-168 lb) and females 40-53 kg (88-117 lb). The tail is 30-45 cm (12-18 in) long. The impala is comparable in size to the <span>kob</span>.</p>

using('aepyceros melampus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Males grow 45-92 cm (18-36 in)-long slender, lyre-shaped horns. The horns have strong ridges and the tips are far apart. They are circular in section and hollow at the base. Their arch-like structure helps the animal to interlock the horns and throw off the opponent. These also protect the <span>cranium</span> from damage.</p>

using('aepyceros melampus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Of the subspecies, the black-faced is significantly larger as well as darker than the common impala. A <span>recessive gene</span> causes the black coloration in these animals. The black tip on the ear is much larger in the former, and the tail is bushier and almost 30% longer.</p>

using('aepyceros melampus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Unlike other antelopes, the impala is an adaptable forager and does not need to migrate long distances. They generally prefer to have water sources nearby, though they can survive on green succulent vegetation if water is scarce. Upper <span>incisors</span> and <span>canines</span> are absent in these <span>ruminants</span>, and the cheek teeth are folded and sharp. It eats both <span>monocot</span> and <span>dicot</span> plants, and also feeds on fruits and <i><span>Acacia</span></i> pods whenever available, providing an adequate and nutritious diet under most circumstances. It switches between grazing and browsing depending on the season and habitat. An analysis showed that the diet of impala consists of 45% monocots, 45% dicots and 10% fruits. The proportion of grasses in their diet increases significantly after the first rains (up to 90% of the diet), but declines in the dry season. In the late wet and dry season, <span>forbs</span> are the main item of the diet. Diets are nutritionally poor in the mid-dry season, when impala feed mostly on woody dicots. Another study revealed that the dicot proportion in the diet is much higher in bachelors and females than in territorial males.</p>

<p>Though males are <span>sexually mature</span> by the time they are a year old, they actually mate only after four years. At this time they establish their own territories. Females can conceive after they are a year and a half old. The annual three-week long breeding season of the impala, also called the <span>rut</span>, begins toward the end of the wet season in May. The males begin preparations for mating in March, including <span>gonadal</span> growth and hormone production, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. Males undergo several physical changes as well, such as darkening of the coat due to greasy secretions from the sebaceous glands, thickening of the neck and acquiring a musky odour. The rut is also influenced by the <span>lunar cycle</span>, with most mating taking place between full moons.</p>

using('aepyceros melampus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Rutting males fight over <span>dominance</span>, often giving out noisy roars and chasing one another. They walk stiffly and <span>display</span> their neck and horns. Territorial males usually reduce feeding and allogrooming during the mating season, probably in order to devote more time on the outlook for females in estrous. The male detects estrous in the female by testing her urine. The <span>estrous cycle</span> is 12 to 29 days and lasts for 24 to 48 hours. On coming across a breeding female, the excited male begins the <span>courtship</span> by chasing the female about. This gradually turns into a walk, with the female 3-5 m (9.8-16.4 ft) ahead of her mate. The male flicks his tongue and may nod vigorously. The female allows him to lick her vulva, and holds her tail to the side. The male tries mounting the female, holding his head high and clasping her with his forelegs. Mounting attempts may be repeated every few seconds to every minute or two. The male loses interest in the female after the first copulation, though she is still active and can mate with other males. He is also no longer interested in maintaining an individual territory, and may join the bachelor herds.</p>

A loud and constant chirper, these birds are very social animals and often congregate in small groups in the wild. They eat throughout the day and take frequent baths. Coloration can vary widely among populations. Plumage is identical in males and females. Lovebirds are renowned for their sleep position in which they sit side-by-side and turn their faces in towards each other. Also, females are well noted to tear raw materials into long strips, "twisty-tie" them onto their backs, and fly substantial distances back to make a nest. They are common in the pet industry, although lovebirds are often not hand-raised.</p>

<p>The hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a head-and-body length of 150 to 245 cm (59 to 96 in). Females weigh from 116 to 185 kg (256 to 408 lb); males weigh from 125 to 218 kg (276 to 481 lb). The tail is 30 to 70 cm (12 to 28 in) long, ending with a black tinge. The other distinctive features of the hartebeest are its long legs (often with black markings), short neck, and pointed ears. Apart from its long face, the large chest and sharply sloping back of the hartebeest can be used to distinguish it from other antelopes. Lifespan is 11 to 20 years in the wild and up to 19 in captivity. The hartebeest shares physical traits with the <span>sassabies</span> (genus <i>Damaliscus</i>), such as an elongated and narrow face, horn shapes, <span>pelage</span> texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail.

While the upper parts are reddish tan, the lateral part is a light tan and the rump whitish in the Lichtenstein's hartebeest. Lichtenstein's hartebeest also possesses dark stripes on its front legs. Swayne's and Tora hartebeest are very similar in appearance, as both have small heads, dark coats, and similar horns. The Swayne's hartebeest is the smaller of the two and has slightly shorter and heavier horns. Fine textured, the body hair of the hartebeest is about 25 mm (0.98 in) long. The hartebeest has <span>preorbital glands</span> with a central duct.

Nine Lichtenstein's hartebeest were sampled for <i><span>Oestrinae</span></i>. Larvae of <i>Gedoelstia</i>, <i><span>Oestrus</span></i> and <i>Kirkioestrus</i> species were isolated from the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. A maximum of 252 larvae were found in the head of one animal, but no <span>pathogenicity</span> was found. A red hartebeest in <span>Gobabis</span> (south-western Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named <i>Longistrongylus meyeri</i> after their collector, T. Meyer, and proposed to be placed in the genus <i>Longistrongylus</i>. In another case, a red hartebeest was infected with theileriosis due to parasites of <i>Rhipicephalus evertsi</i> and <i><span>Theileria</span></i> species. Parasites in the hartebeest alternate between living off gazelles and wildebeest. South of the Sahara, the hartebeest can be infested by <i><span>Loewioestrus variolosus</span></i>, <i><span>Gedoelstia cristata</span></i> and <i><span>G. hassleri</span></i>.

<p>Hartebeest mating occurs throughout the year. Peaks can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach <span>sexual maturity</span> at one to two years of age. Reproduction depends on the subspecies and population at the time of mating. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas on <span>plateaus</span> or <span>ridges</span>. The males can fight fiercely for dominance. The dominant male smells the female's genitals, and follows her if she is in <span>oestrus</span>. Sometimes a female holds out her tail slightly to signal her being in heat. He will try to block the female's way. When she stops, she allows the male to mount her. Copulation occurs quickly, and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, the female mates with several males. Gestation is about 240 days, after which a single calf is born. The newborn weighs about 9 kg (20 lb). Births take place in thickets, unlike wildebeest, which give birth in groups on the plains. The offspring is weaned at four months. A male accompanies his mother for two and a half years, longer than other alcelaphines.</p>

<p>The adult Black Crake is 19-23 cm (7.5-9.1 in) long with a short tail and long toes. As its name implies, the adult has mainly black plumage, with a brown olive tone on the wings and upperparts which is rarely detectable in the field. The eye is red, the bill is yellow (hence the <i>flavirostra</i> of the binomial name), and the legs and feet are red, duller when not breeding.</p>

using('amaurornis flavirostra')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The habitat of this common to abundant species is freshwater <span>marshes</span> of all types, as long as there is some vegetation to provide cover. Many rails are very secretive, but the Black Crake is often seen out in the open. It has benefited from human activity in the form of deforestation, and is rarely hunted because of its unpalatable flesh.</p>

<p>This is a large duck, and the male's long central tail feathers give rise to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running from the back of its chocolate-coloured head down its neck to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female <span>dabbling ducks</span>. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.</p>

<p>The northern pintail is a fairly large duck with a <span>wing chord</span> of 23.6-28.2 cm (9.3-11.1 in) and wingspan of 80-95 cm (31-37 in). The male is 59-76 cm (23-30 in) in length and weighs 450-1,360 g (0.99-3.00 lb), and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is 51-64 cm (20-25 in) long and weighs 454-1,135 g (1.001-2.502 lb). The northern pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly-widespread <span>mallard</span>, but is more slender, elongated and gracile, with a relatively longer neck and (in males) a longer tail. The unmistakable breeding <span>plumaged</span> male has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail, which has the central feathers elongated to as much as 10 cm (3.9 in). The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.</p>

using('anas acuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown <span>speculum</span> with a narrower trailing edge.</p>

<p>Around three-quarters of chicks live long enough to fledge, but not more than half of those survive long enough to reproduce. The maximum recorded age is 27 years and 5 months for a <span>Dutch</span> bird.</p>

using('anas acuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The pintail feeds by dabbling and upending in shallow water for plant food mainly in the evening or at night, and therefore spends much of the day resting. Its long neck enables it to take food items from the bottom of water bodies up to 30 cm (12 in) deep, which are beyond the reach of other dabbling ducks like the Mallard.</p>

<p>Hunting with lead shot, along with the use of lead sinkers in <span>angling</span>, has been identified as a major cause of <span>lead poisoning</span> in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A <span>Spanish</span> study showed that northern pintail and <span>common pochard</span> were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned.

<p>Pintails in North America at least have been badly affected by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5 million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.</p>

<p>The Eurasian teal belongs to the "true" teals, a group of small <i><span>Anas</span></i> dabbling ducks closely related to the <span>mallard</span> (<i>A. platyrhynchos</i>) and its relatives; that latter group in fact seems to have <span>evolved</span> from a true teal.

<p>The Eurasian teal was first scientifically named by <span>Carl Linnaeus</span> in his 1758 edition of <i><span>Systema naturae</span></i>. His <span>Latin</span> description reads: <i>[Anas] macula alarum viridi, linea alba supra infraque oculos</i> - "a duck with green speculum, a white line above and below the eyes" - and his primary reference was the bird's description in his earlier work <i>Fauna Svecica</i>. In fact, the description he used in <i>Systema Naturae</i> was the name under which the bird went in the <i>Fauna Svecica</i>, demonstrating the value of his new <span>binomial nomenclature</span> by compressing the long-winded names formerly used in <span>biological classification</span> into much simpler <span>scientific names</span> like <i>Anas crecca</i>. Linnaeus also noted in his description that earlier authors had already written about the Eurasan teal at length: <span>Conrad Gessner</span> had described it in the <i><span>Historiae animalium</span></i> as the <i>anas parva</i> ("small duck") among his <i>querquedulae</i> ("teals"); <span>Ulisse Aldrovandi</span> had called it <i>phascade</i> or <i>querquedula minor</i> ("lesser teal"), and was duly referenced by <span>Francis Willughby</span> who named the species <i>querquedula secunda Aldrovandi</i> ("the second teal of Aldrovandus"). <span>John Ray</span> may be credited with formally introducing the name "common teal", while <span>Eleazar Albin</span> called it simply "the teal". As regards the <span>type locality</span> Linnaeus simply remarked that it inhabits <span>freshwater</span> ecosystems in <span>Europe</span>.</p>

<p>The Eurasian teal breeds across northern <span>Eurasia</span> and mostly winters well south of its breeding range. However, in the milder climate of <span>temperate</span> <span>Europe</span>, the summer and winter ranges overlap. For example, in the <span>United Kingdom</span> and <span>Ireland</span> a small summer population breeds, but far greater numbers of <span>Siberian</span> birds arrive in winter. In the <span>Caucasus</span> region, western <span>Asia Minor</span>, along the northern shores of the <span>Black Sea</span>, and even on the south coast of <span>Iceland</span> and on the <span>Vestmannaeyjar</span>, the species can be encountered all year, too.</p>

<p>It nests on the ground, near water and under cover. The pairs form in the winter quarters and arrive on the breeding grounds together, starting about March. The breeding starts some weeks thereafter, not until May in the most northernly locations. The nest is a deep hollow lined with dry leaves and <span>down feathers</span>, built in dense vegetation near water. After the females have started laying, the males leave them and move away for shorter or longer distances, assembling in flocks on particular lakes where they <span>moult</span> into <span>eclipse plumage</span>; they will usually encounter their offspring only in winter quarters. The <span>clutch</span> may consist of 5-16 eggs, but usually numbers 8-11; they are incubated for 21-23 days. The young leave the nest soon after hatching and are attended by the mother for about 25-30 days, after which they <span>fledge</span>. The drakes and the hens with young generally move to the winter quarters separately. After the first winter, the young moult into adult plumage. The maximum recorded lifespan - though it is not clear whether this refers to the common or the green-winged teal&#x2014;was over 27 years, which is rather high for such a small bird.</p>

<p>Unlike many other waterbirds the feathers of the African darter do not contain any oil and are therefore not waterproof. Because of this, the bird is less positively buoyant and its diving capabilities are enhanced. After diving for fish, the feathers can become waterlogged.

using('antidorcas marsupialis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The specific epithet <i>marsupialis</i> (<span>Latin</span>: <i>marsupium</i>, "pocket") derives from a pocket-like skin flap which extends along the middle of the back from the tail onwards. When the male springbok is showing off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, jumping up into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. This ritual is known as <span>stotting or pronking</span> from the Afrikaans meaning to boast or show off.</p>

using('antidorcas marsupialis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Springboks are slender, long-necked antelopes, with a total length of 150 to 195 cm (59 to 77 in), and horns present in both sexes. Adults are between 70 and 90 cm (28 and 35 in) tall at the shoulder, depending on weight and gender; they weigh between 30 and 44 kg (66 and 97 lb) for the females and 33 and 48 kg (73 and 106 lb) for the males. The tail is 15 to 30 centimetres (5.9 to 11.8 in) long.</p>

using('antidorcas marsupialis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Their colouring consists of a pattern of white, reddish/tan and dark brown. Their backs are tan-coloured and they are white beneath, with a dark brown stripe extending along each side from the shoulder to inside the thigh. The face is white in adults, with a dark patch on the forehead, and a stripe running from just above the eyes to the corner of the mouth. The hooves and horns are black, and the tail is white with a black tuft at the tip.</p>

using('antidorcas marsupialis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Rams are slightly larger than ewes, and have thick horns; the ewes tend to have skinnier legs and longer, more frail horns. The horns are, however, of similar shape in both sexes, with a hook-like tip that curves inwards, and a series of rings along their length. The average horn length for both genders is 35 cm (14 in), with the record being a female with horns measuring 49.21 centimetres (19.37 in). Springbok footprints are narrow and sharp, and are 5.5 cm (2.2 in) long. springbok are distinguished from <span>gazelles</span> in that they only have two <span>premolar</span> teeth in each side of each jaw, instead of three, and therefore a total of twenty eight teeth, rather than thirty.</p>

<p>Outside of the rut, mixed sex herds can range from as few as three to as many as 180 individuals, while all-male bachelor herds are of typically no more than fifty individuals. Harem and nursery herds are much smaller, typically including no more than ten individuals. The <span>Dutch</span>/<span>Afrikaans</span> term <i><span>trekbokken</span></i> refers to the large-scale migration of herds of springbok seen roaming the country during the early pioneer days of South Africa before farm fences were erected. Millions of migrating springbok formed herds hundreds of kilometres long that could take several days to pass a town. These are the largest herds of mammals ever witnessed.</p>

<p>Springbok mate year-round, although females may be more likely to enter <span>oestrus</span> during the rainy season, when food is more plentiful. During the rut, males establish territories, ranging from 10 to 70 hectares (25 to 173 acres), which they mark by urinating and depositing large piles of dung. Males in neighbouring territories frequently fight for access to females, which they do by twisting and levering at each other with their horns, interspersed with occasional stabbing attacks. Females wander between the territories of different males, rather than remaining in a single one for long periods of time. When one approaches a territorial male, the male holds his head and tail out horizontally, lowers his horns and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's <span>perineum</span>. If the female is receptive, she also urinates, and the male makes a <span>flehmen</span> gesture, and taps her leg until the female either leaves or permits him to mate.</p>

using('aonyx capensis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>African clawless otters can be found anywhere from open coastal plains, to semiarid regions, to densely forested areas. Surviving mostly in southern <span>Africa</span>, the otters live in areas surrounding permanent bodies of water, usually surrounded by some form of foliage. Logs, branches, and loose foliage greatly appeal to the otter as this provides shelter, shade, and great rolling opportunities. Slow and rather clumsy on land, they build burrows in banks near water, allowing for easier food access and a quick escape from predators. In the False Bay area of the Cape Peninsula, they have been observed scavenging along beaches and rocks and hunting in shallow surf for mullet. They are mainly nocturnal in urban areas and lie up during the day in quiet, bushy areas.</p>

using('aonyx capensis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The biggest threat to African clawless otters comes from humans. <i>Aonyx</i> specimens will often forage in man-made fisheries and may be hunted or become entangled in nets. Overfishing by humans may reduce the food supply available to otters. They are sometimes hunted for their thick, soft pelts, which humans use in forms of clothing. In forested areas, logging may be a major threat, since erosion leads to greatly increased turbidity in rivers which can in turn greatly reduce the populations of fish on which the otters depend. This may well be a far greater threat to otters than hunting. The <span>Otter Trail</span> is a hiking trail in <span>South Africa</span> named after the African clawless otter, which is found in this area. Otters along the trail are protected, as it falls within the <span>Tsitsikamma National Park</span>.</p>

<p>The king penguin is able to breed at three years of age, although only a very small minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. King penguins are <span>serially monogamous</span>. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle may contribute to this low rate.</p>

using('aptenodytes patagonicus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The king penguin has an unusually prolonged breeding cycle, taking some 14-16 months from laying to offspring fledging. Although pairs will attempt to breed annually, they are generally only successful one year in two, or two years in three in a triennial pattern on South Georgia. The reproductive cycle begins in September to November, as birds return to colonies for a prenuptial moult. Those that were unsuccessful in breeding the previous season will often arrive earlier. They then return to the sea for three weeks before coming ashore in November or December. The female penguin lays one pyriform (pear-shaped) white <span>egg</span> weighing 300 <span>g</span> (&#x2154; lb). It is initially soft, but hardens and darkens to a pale greenish colour. It measures around 10 cm &#xD7; 7 cm (3.9 in &#xD7; 2.8 in). The egg is incubated for around 55 days with both birds sharing incubation in shifts of 6-18 days each. Hatching may take up to 2-3 days to complete, and chicks are born <span>semi-altricial and nidicolous</span>. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The <i>guard phase</i> starts with the birth of the chick. The young chick spends its time balanced on its parents' feet, sheltered by a pouch formed from the abdominal skin of the latter. During this time, the parents alternate every 3-7 days, one guarding the chick while the other forages. The guard phase lasts for 30-40 days. By then the chick has grown much bigger, can keep itself warm and protect itself against most predators. It becomes more curious and starts to explore its surroundings. It ends up forming a group with other chicks, a so-called <span>cr&#xE8;che</span>. Cr&#xE8;ches are guarded by only a few adult birds; most parents can leave their chick to forage for themselves and their chick. Other species of penguins also practice this method of communal care for offspring.</p>

<p><b>Verreaux's Eagle</b> (<i>Aquila verreauxii</i>) is a large <span>African</span> <span>bird of prey</span>. It is also called the <b>Black Eagle</b>, especially in <span>Southern Africa</span>, leading to potential confusion with the Indian <span>Black Eagle</span> (<i>Ictinaetus malayensis</i>), which lives in Asia. Verreaux's Eagle lives in hilly and mountainous regions of <span>southern</span> and <span>eastern Africa</span> (extending marginally into <span>Chad</span>), and very locally in <span>West Africa</span>, the <span>Arabian Peninsula</span> and the southern <span>Middle East</span>. It is one of the most specialized species of accipitrid in the world, with its distribution and life history revolving around its favorite prey species, the <span>rock hyraxes</span>. When hyrax populations decline, the species have been shown to survive with mixed success on other prey, such as small <span>antelopes</span>, <span>gamebirds</span>, <span>hares</span>, <span>monkeys</span> and other assorted vertebrates. Despite a high degree of specialization, Verreaux's Eagle has, from a conservation standpoint, been faring relatively well in historic times. One population of this species, in the <span>Matobo Hills</span> of <span>Zimbabwe</span>, is arguably the best studied eagle population in the world, having been subject to continuous detailed study since the late 1950s. Like all <span>eagles</span>, this species belongs to the taxonomic order <span>Accipitriformes</span> (formerly included in <span>Falconiformes</span>) and the family <span>Accipitridae</span>, which may be referred to colloquially as accipitrids or raptors.</p>

<p>This <span>species</span> was first described by <span>Ren&#xE9; Primev&#xE8;re Lesson</span> in his 1830 publication, <i>Centurie zoologique, ou choix d'animaux rares, nouveaux ou imparfaitement connus</i>, as <i>Aquila Verreauxii</i>. The species&#x2019; name commemorates the French naturalist <span>Jules Verreaux</span>, who visited <span>southern Africa</span> in the early 18th century and collected the type specimen for the <span>French Academy of Sciences</span>. Verreaux's Eagle is part of a broad group of raptors called &#x201C;booted eagles&#x201D; which are defined by the feature that all included species have - feathering over their tarsus, whereas most other accipitrids have bare legs. Included in this group are all species described as &#x201C;hawk eagles&#x201D; including the genera <i><span>Spizaetus</span></i> and <i><span>Nisaetus</span></i>, as well as assorted <span>monotypical genera</span> such as <i><span>Oroaetus</span></i>, <i><span>Lophaetus</span></i>, <i><span>Stephanoaetus</span></i>, <i><span>Polemaetus</span></i>, <i><span>Lophotriorchis</span></i> and <i><span>Ictinaetus</span></i>. The genus <i><span>Aquila</span></i> is distributed across every continent but for <span>South America</span> and <span>Antarctica</span>. Up to 20 species have been classified in the genus but the taxonomic placement of some of the traditionally included species has recently been questioned. Traditionally, the <i>Aquila</i> eagles have been grouped superficially as largish, mainly brownish or dark-colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages. Genetic research has recently indicated the Verreaux's Eagle is included in a <span>clade</span> with the near circumpolar <span>Golden Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) as well as the <span>Gurney's Eagle</span> (<i>A. gurneyi</i>) and the <span>Wedge-tailed Eagle</span> (<i>A. audax</i>) (clearly part of an Australasian radiation of the lineage). This identification of this particular clade has long been suspected based on similar morphological characteristics amongst these large-bodied species. More surprisingly, the smaller, much paler-bellied sister species <span>Bonelli's Eagle</span> (<i>A. fasciatus</i>) and <span>African Hawk-Eagle</span> (<i>A. spilogaster</i>), previously included in the <i>Hieraaetus</i> genus, have been revealed to be genetically much closer to the Verreaux's and Golden Eagle lineage than to other species traditionally included in the <i>Aquila</i> genus. Other largish <i>Aquila</i> species, the <span>Eastern Imperial Eagle</span> (<i>A. heliaca</i>), the <span>Spanish Imperial Eagle</span> (<i>A. adaberti</i>), the <span>Tawny Eagle</span> (<i>A. rapax</i>) and the <span>Steppe Eagles</span> (<i>A. nipalensis</i>), are now thought to be separate, close-knit clade, which attained some similar characteristics to the prior clade via convergent evolution. Genetically, the &#x201C;spotted eagles&#x201D; (<i><span>A. pomarina</span>, <span>hasata</span> &amp; <span>clanga</span></i>), have been discovered to be more closely related to the <span>Long-crested Eagle</span> (<i>Lophaetus occipitalis</i>) and the <span>Black Eagle</span>, and many generic reassignments have been advocated. The <i>Hieraaetus</i> genus, including the <span>Booted Eagle</span> (<i>H. pennatus</i>), <span>Little Eagle</span> (<i>H. morphnoides</i>) and <span>Ayres's Hawk-Eagle</span> (<i>H. ayresii</i>), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact the smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated <i><span>Spilornis</span></i> serpent-eagle genus. This genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and is now occasionally also included in <i>Aquila</i>, although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification. The small-bodied <span>Wahlberg's Eagle</span> (<i>H. wahlbergi</i>) has been traditionally considered an <i>Aquila</i> species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color but it is actually genetically aligned to the <i>Hieraaetus</i> lineage. <span>Cassin's Hawk-Eagle</span> (<i>H. africanus</i>) is also probably closely related to the <i>Hieraaetus</i> group rather than the <i>Spizaetus/Nisaetus</i> &#x201C;hawk-eagle&#x201D; group (in which it was previously classified) which is not known to have radiated to Africa.</p>

<p>Verreaux's Eagle is a very large eagle. It measures 75 to 96 cm (30 to 38 in) long from the bill to the tip of the tail, making it the sixth longest eagle in the world. Males can weigh 3 to 4.2 kg (6.6 to 9.3 lb) and the larger females weigh 3.1 to 5.8 kg (6.8 to 12.8 lb). The average weight is approximately 4.1 kg (9.0 lb). It is the eighth heaviest living eagle in the world. It has a wingspan of 1.81 to 2.3 m (5 ft 11 in to 7 ft 7 in). The <span>wing chord</span> of the male is 56.5 to 59.5 cm (22.2 to 23.4 in) and that of the female is 59 to 64 cm (23 to 25 in). Among other standard measurements in the Verreaux's Eagles, both sexes measure 27.2 to 36 cm (10.7 to 14.2 in) in tail length and 9.5 to 11 cm (3.7 to 4.3 in) in <span>tarsus length</span>. Other than the female&#x2019;s slight size advantage, adult males and females are physically indistinguishable from each other. Adult Verreaux's Eagles are mostly jet-black in color. The yellow coloration of the cere (the bill is gun-metal grey), eye-ring and &#x201C;eye-brows&#x201D;, all stand out in contrast to the black plumage. Even more prominent on flying birds when seen from above is the white on the back, rump and upper-tail coverts and part of the scapulars, which forms a V-shaped patch, although this feature is partially obscured in perched birds. Adults also have conspicuous white windows on the wing quills at the carpal joint (at the base of the primaries) when seen flying both from above and below. The bill is stout, the head is prominent on the relatively long neck and the legs are fully feathered.</p>

<p>Verreaux's Eagle has precise habitat requirements and is rare outside of its particular habitat type. It lives in <span>kopjes</span>, which are dry, rocky environments in anything from rocky <span>hills</span> to high <span>mountains</span> amongst <span>cliffs</span>, <span>gorges</span> and <span>inselbergs</span> often surrounded by <span>savanna</span>, <span>thornbush</span> and <span>sub-desert</span>. It is often found in dry areas with less than 60 cm (24 in) of average annual rainfall. It is highest ranging in elevation in Ethiopia and East Africa, where found up to 4,000 m (13,000 ft) above sea level. Verreaux's Eagle is found from the <span>Marra Mountains</span> of <span>Sudan</span> southward through that country to 16&#xB0;N in <span>Eritrea</span>, along the northern mountains of <span>Somalia</span>, in much of <span>Ethiopia</span> (mostly the central, mountainous spine), possibly some mountains in northeastern <span>Uganda</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, easternmost <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span> and possibly <span>Tanzania</span>. Southeastern Africa is the heart of the Verreaux's Eagle range: they are found in most mountain ranges in <span>Malawi</span> but for the <span>Nyika Plateau</span>, the <span>Mafinga Hills</span> and the Lulwe Hills, in <span>Zambia</span> (especially the escarpments bordering <span>Lake Kariba</span> to the gorges below <span>Victoria Falls</span>), in <span>Zimbabwe</span> (especially east of the central plateau),<span>Mozambique</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Lesotho</span> and down into <span>South Africa</span>, where they largely inhabit the <span>Karoo</span> and <span>Cape Peninsula</span>. A somewhat more sparse distribution is known in <span>Botswana</span>, western <span>Namibia</span> and southwestern <span>Angola</span> (in the <span>Serra da Chela</span>). Elsewhere in Africa, the Verreaux's Eagle may be found but tends to be rare and only spottily seen, such as in eastern <span>Mali</span>, northeastern <span>Chad</span>, the <span>A&#xEF;r Mountains</span> of <span>Niger</span> and southwestern <span>Cameroon</span> (where known only as a vagrant). In 1968, only a single record of Verreaux's Eagle (from <span>Jordan</span>) was known from outside of Africa, but now it is known they are a rare breeder out of their main continent. From a handful of immature records and territorial adult behavior, breeding as been inferred in <span>Lebanon</span>, <span>Israel</span>, <span>Oman</span>, <span>Saudi Arabia</span> and <span>Yemen</span>.</p>

<p>Of the two species regularly taken, the Yellow-spotted Rock Hyrax can weigh from 1 to 3.63 kg (2.2 to 8.0 lb) with an average of 2.4 kg (5.3 lb), although specimens from <span>Zimbabwe</span> are noticeably heavier and larger than specimens from <span>Serengeti National Park</span>. Cape Hyrax, weighing from 1.8 to 5.5 kg (4.0 to 12.1 lb) with average of around 3.14 kg (6.9 lb), can be even larger than the Verreaux&#x2019;s Eagles themselves, so can be more difficult to kill. Yellow-spotted Rock Hyraxes are more often taken in the Matobo Hills, perhaps because of their smaller size or its more diurnal habits. Adult rock hyraxes were disproportionately selected, perhaps due to being out in the open more regularly. In Cape Hyraxes, 1 to 2 year old males are particularly vulnerable, since they are forced to disperse at sexual maturity. Juvenile hyraxes constituted from 11-33% of prey remains in the Western Cape while 18% of hyraxes killed were juveniles in Matobo Hills. Because of their greater weight, Cape Hyraxes are frequently either consumed at the kill site (putting the eagle at risk of losing prey to competing predators or to attack by large mammalian carnivores) or are decapitated and brought to the nest or perch. Fewer skulls or jaws of Cape Hyraxes have been found at nest sites than Yellow-spotted Rock Hyrax skulls. However, the Cape Hyrax has a wider distribution than the Yellow-spotted and the Verreaux's Eagle may hunt the Cape Hyrax almost exclusively outside of the long band of eastern Africa where the smaller species is distributed. In comparison to the Golden Eagle, Verreaux's Eagle has a foot pad that&#x2019;s about 20% wider, which is possibly an adaptation to taking the bulky and broad-backed rock hyrax. The foot of the Verreaux's Eagle is reportedly even larger than a human hand. In <span>South Africa</span>, where the Cape hyrax is the main prey species, the estimated mean size of prey taken to the nest is around 2.6 kg (5.7 lb), perhaps twice as heavy as prey taken by some nesting Golden Eagles. However, the mean size of prey taken by Verreaux's Eagle in the Matobo Hills, with more Yellow-spotted rock hyrax, was around 1.82 kg (4.0 lb), around the same estimated weight as prey taken by Golden Eagles in <span>Europe</span> and smaller than the average estimated mass of prey taken to Golden Eagle nests in some regions, like <span>Scotland</span> or <span>Mongolia</span>.</p>

<p>A rough estimated average of home range size in Verreaux's Eagle is 10.9 km (4.2 sq mi). Density of breeding pairs varies from 1 pair per 10.3 km (4.0 sq mi) in the <span>Matobo Hills</span>, <span>Zimbabwe</span>, 1 pair per 24 km (9.3 sq mi) in the <span>Karoo</span>, 1 pair per 25 km (9.7 sq mi) in <span>East Africa</span>, 1 pair per 28 km (11 sq mi) in the <span>Bale Mountains</span> of <span>Ethiopia</span> to a known maximum spacing of 1 pair per 35 to 65 km (14 to 25 sq mi) in the <span>Magaliesberg</span> and <span>Drakensberg</span> ranges. The Matobo Hills reportedly has one of the greatest breeding densities known of any large eagle and territories are extremely stable through seasons and years. Such stable distributions are expected of long-lived raptors living in the tropics with a relatively stable food supply outside the seasonal variation of temperate zones. While Matobo Hill home ranges ranged from 6 to 14 km (2.3 to 5.4 sq mi), most were observed to include about the same amount of kopje habitat (up to 5 km (1.9 sq mi)). Populations fluctuate surprisingly little despite four-fold changes between peaks and troughs in hyrax numbers. At troughs, eagles may temporarily disappear or switch to alternate prey. This is only especially marked in drought periods and on average occurs once every 20 years. Some authors consider the Verreaux's Eagle to be a partial migrant, others describe it as sedentary. This is more a matter of terminology than unclear behaviour, since this species is well known to behave like almost all raptors that breed in sub-Saharan Africa. That is the young wander relatively widely once dispersed from their parent&#x2019;s territory but the adults generally remain sedentary on their home range for the remainder of their lives.</p>

using('aquila verreauxii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Verreaux's Eagle displays may potentially occur almost throughout the year. Frequently displays are in response to the presence of another soaring pair or after repelling a single intruder from the territory. They will also display if anxious about the nest when humans or other large mammals approach too closely. The male&#x2019;s display often consists of him first flying up in an undulating flight with wings readily held spread or closed. Then, once at a great height, he plunges down as far as 305 m (1,001 ft) at a time, then quickly rises back up, sometimes swinging to and fro like the arms of a pendulum, at other times diving and rising along a straight line. These evolutions may be embellished with somersaults and sideways rolls at the peak before the descent. Some displays involve pairs of eagles. A pair frequently circles or makes figures of eight over their territory. One bird may roll over and present claws in flight or the male may fly behind female with exaggeratedly upcurved wings. It is now the prevalent thought that most displays in <i>Aquila</i> eagles are territorial, as they often occur along the boundary of a given home range rather than near the nest. Displays with talon-grappling and tumbling are often aerial fights between territorial birds and occasionally the eagles may clasp and whirl downwards (one such fight reportedly resulting in the birds plunging into the sea).</p>

<p>Egg laying may occur from November to August in <span>Sudan</span> and <span>Arabia</span>, October to May in <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Somalia</span>, year around in <span>East Africa</span> (with a peak of June to December) and anywhere from April to November in Africa from <span>Zambia</span> southwards. In an unusual behaviour for eagles, the males may bring food to females before egg laying and, more typically, males bring almost all food during the incubation stage. Two eggs are generally laid, though a range of one to three is known. The eggs are rather elongated ovals and being chalky white sometimes with a bluish tinge or a few reddish-brown marking, measuring from 71 to 83.4 mm (2.80 to 3.28 in) in length and 56-62 mm (2.2-2.4 in) in width, with an average of 76.9 mm &#xD7; 58.6 mm (3.03 in &#xD7; 2.31 in). The eggs are laid at three day intervals starting in the middle of the day. Both sexes incubate, but the female takes the major share and tends to sit all night over them. Sometimes, the male may sit for 40-50% of the day with more shifts for him towards the end of incubation. These are close-sitters, which are not easily disturbed off the nest. Incubation is 43 to 47 days. Hatching happens at about to 2-3 days apart, with about 24 hours from the first chipping of the egg&#x2019;s surface to complete hatching. One egg is sometimes infertile and the second egg tends to be about 10% smaller. The Verreaux's Eagle is considered an &#x201C;obligate cainist&#x201D;, that is the older sibling normally kills the younger one (in more than 90% of observed nests), by either starvation or direct attack. Aggression may continue for up to 70 days after hatching. At one time no cases of two young successfully reaching the fledging stage were known, however a couple of cases of two healthy fledglings from a nest have been recorded. Siblicide is regularly observed in raptorial birds, including unrelated families like <span>owls</span> and <span>skuas</span> and is common, even typical, of <i>Aquila</i> eagles. The behaviour is most commonly explained as a kind of insurance policy, with the second nestling existing both to act as a backup if the first egg or nestling perishes and to mitigate the stressful workload demanded of the parent raptors in feeding, brooding and defending the young. The odds of survival for the second fledging are better in the Golden Eagle and other temperate-breeding <i>Aquila</i> eagles, possibly due to a shorter nesting stage in these species. In roughly 20% of Golden Eagle nests and in some cases, such as prey-rich areas of <span>North America</span>, about half of the nests will successfully produce two fledglings. In the Verreaux's Eagle, no food is given to the hatchling in the first 36 hours, thereafter they are regularly feed. Early in the fledging stage, the young is brooded up to 90% of the time. After 20 days, parents spend up to 20% of time with their eaglet around the nest, not brooding in daylight after 21 days. Feathers appear through the down at about 34 days, by 60 days feathers cover the down. In Equatorial Africa, the eaglet fledges from the nest at 95-99 days, though sometimes as little as 90 days further south. In the Golden Eagle, the fledging stage is roughly 35 days shorter. The young Verreaux's Eagle takes its first flight and then returns to the nest for the first fortnight. In the early fledging period, the male brings more food, later it is largely the female. At some point during the post-fledging stage, she ceases to roost with the young one and sits with the male at some distance, a behaviour that seems to vary from nest to nest in timing. After 45-50 days, food is caught by the parents but is likely eaten by themselves and not brought to the young. After leaving the nest, family parties may be together for up to 6 months. The eaglet grows stronger after the first month and accompanies the parents on hunting forays away from the nest. It often breeds every year, occasionally only on every other year.</p>

<p>Adult and subadult males may form groups while <span>moulting</span> along the <span>Antarctic Peninsula</span> in late summer and early autumn. Adult females are gregarious but relatively asocial other than the strong bond they establish with their pups, although there are occasional aggressive encounters with nearby females or other pups and brief interactions with adult males to mate. These seals appear to be solitary when foraging and migrating. Females evidently remain at sea continually between breeding seasons, and juveniles may spend several years at sea before returning to natal sites to mate for the first time. The deepest recorded dive is about 180 m deep; the longest dive lasted 10 minutes. The diving ability of pups substantially improves during the first few months of life, and by about four months old their diving patterns are similar to those of adult females. <span>Leopard seals</span> eat Antarctic fur seal pups. Survival of suckling pups may be particularly low in years when krill abundance near a colony is insufficient to allow lactating females to forage effectively.</p>

<p>The breeding system of the Antarctic Fur Seal is <span>polygynous</span>, and dominant breeding males mate with as many as 20 females during a successful season. Adult males establish breeding territories on beaches in late October to mid November, preferably just along the shoreline. They are fiercely territorial during the breeding season and aggressively defend access to <span>estrous</span> females from other males, mostly with stereotyped physical displays, lunges, and vocalizations. These fights can be very damaging. Many bulls die from their wounds. Males may fast during the breeding season for six to eight weeks, losing up to 1.5 kg a day. The <span>gestation period</span> lasts about a year. Females give birth to a single pup between mid November and late December. They mate about 7 to 10 days later and then begin a series of foraging trips at sea that lasts for several days each. In between, they are ashore for one to several days to nurse their pups. Pups are weaned at about four months old.</p>

They have external ear flaps (pinnae) and their whiskers (vibrissae) are long, and may extend backward past the pinnae, especially in adult males. The foreflippers are covered with sparse hair over about three-quarters of their length. The hindflippers are short relative to the large body, with short, fleshy tips on the digits. The size and weight of the brown fur seal depends on the subspecies. The Southern African subspecies is on average slightly larger than the Australian subspecies. Males of the African subspecies (<i>A. p. pusillus</i>) are 2.3 metres (7.5 ft) in length on average and weigh from 200-300 kilograms (440-660 lb). Females are smaller, averaging 1.8 metres (5.9 ft) in length and weighing an average of 120 kilograms (260 lb). Males of the Australian subspecies (<i>A. p. doriferus</i>) are 2-2.2 metres (6.6-7.2 ft) in length and weigh 190-280 kilograms (420-620 lb). Females are 1.2-1.8 metres (3.9-5.9 ft) length and weigh 36-110 kilograms (79-243 lb).</p>

<p>The African fur seal&#x2019;s diet is made of up to 70% fish, 20% squid and 2% crab. Also eaten are other crustaceans, cephalopods and sometimes birds. In rare instances they have even been documented attacking and eating sharks. A recent incident occurred off Cape Point, South Africa, where a large male was observed attacking and killing five <span>blue sharks</span> between 1 and 1.4 metres long. Observers concluded that the seal likely killed the sharks to eat the fish rich contents of their stomachs as well as their livers as a source of energy. The Australian fur seal mostly eats squid, <span>octopus</span>, fish and lobsters. The brown fur seal dives for its food. The African subspecies can dive as deep as 204m and for as long as 7.5 minutes. The Australian subspecies generally feeds at lower depths, diving on average 120m and can reach as deep as 200m.</p>

<p>The Goliath heron is very aquatic, even by heron standards, rarely venturing far from a water source and preferring to fly along waterways rather than move over land. Important habitats can include lakes, swamps, <span>mangrove</span> <span>wetlands</span>, <span>reefs</span> with few cool water, sometimes <span>river deltas</span>. It typically is found in shallows, though can be observed near deep water over dense water vegetation. Goliath herons can even be found in small watering holes. They have ranged in elevation from sea level to 2,100 m (6,900 ft). They tend to prefer pristine wetlands and generally avoid areas where human disturbances are a regular occurrence.</p>

using('ardea goliath')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Goliath herons are solitary foragers and are highly territorial towards other Goliaths entering their feeding territories (Whitfield and Blaber 1978, Mock and Mock 1980). On occasions, two may be seen together but these are most likely to a be breeding pair or immatures. A diurnal and often rather inactive feeder, this heron often hunts by standing in the shallows, intently watching the water at its feet. This is a typical feeding method among large <i><span>Ardea</span></i> herons and it can forage in deeper waters than most due to its larger size. It may also perch on heavy floating vegetation, in order to prevent water from rippling around them. As prey appears, the heron rapidly spears it with open mandibles, often spearing both mandibles through the fish's body, and then swallows it whole. It is possible that the bill is used in a lure-like fashion occasionally, attracting fish to the immobile, large large object submerged in the water. The handling period is long, with herons often placing their struggling prey on floating vegetation while preparing to swallow it. Due to its generally slow movements and handling time, the Goliath is frequently vulnerable to <span>kleptoparasitism</span>. In Africa, <span>African fish eagles</span> frequently pirate food caught by Goliaths, although other large birds such as <span>saddle-billed storks</span> and <span>pelicans</span> may also steal their prey.</p>

It is a member of the <span>bustard</span> <span>family</span>, which all belong to the order <span>Gruiformes</span> and are restricted in distribution to the <span>Old World</span>. It is one of the four species (ranging from Africa to <span>India</span> to <span>Australia</span>) in the large-bodied <i>Ardeotis</i> genus. In fact, the male Kori Bustard may be the heaviest living animal capable of flight. This species, like most bustards, is a ground-dwelling bird and an opportunistic omnivore. Male Kori Bustards, which can be more than twice as heavy than the female, attempt to breed with as many females as possible and then take no part in the raising of the young. The nest is a shallow hallow into the earth, often disguised by nearby obstructive objects such as trees. The specific epithet <i>kori</i> is derived from the <span>Tswana</span> name for this bird - <i>Kgori</i>.</p>

using('ardeotis kori')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Kori Bustard is found throughout southern Africa, except in densely wooded areas. They are common in <span>Botswana</span> and <span>Namibia</span>, extending into southern <span>Angola</span> and marginally into southwestern <span>Zambia</span>. In <span>Zimbabwe</span> they are generally sparse but locally common, particularly on the central plateau. Their distribution range extends along the <span>Limpopo River</span> valley into southern <span>Mozambique</span> and the eastern lowveld of <span>South Africa</span>. In South Africa they are also infrequent to rare in the <span>Free State</span>, <span>North West</span> and <span>Northern Cape Provinces</span>, extending southwards into the interior of the <span>Western</span> and <span>Eastern Cape Provinces</span>. Kori Bustards are absent from the coastal lowlands along the south and east of South Africa and from high mountainous areas. This species is common in <span>Tanzania</span> at <span>Ngorongoro National Park</span>, <span>Kitulo National Park</span> and <span>Serengeti National Park</span>. A geographically disjunct population also occurs in the deserts and savanna of northeastern Africa. Here, the species ranges from extreme south <span>Sudan</span>, north <span>Somalia</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span> through all of <span>Kenya</span> (except coastal regions), <span>Tanzania</span> and <span>Uganda</span>. Kenya may hold the largest population of Kori Bustards of any country and it can even border on abundant in the <span>North Eastern Province</span>. They are usually residential in their range, with some random, nomadic movement following rainfall.</p>

using('ardeotis kori')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This species occurs in open grassy areas, often characterized by sandy soil, especially <span>Kalahari sands</span>, and short grass usually near the cover of isolated clumps of trees or bushes. It may be found in plains, arid plateaus, <span>highveld grassland</span>, arid scrub, lightly wooded savanna, open dry <span>bushveld</span> and semi-desert. Where this species occurs, annual rainfall is quite low, at between 100 and 600 mm (3.9 and 23.6 in). Breeding habitat is savanna in areas with sparse grass cover and scattered trees and shrubs. When nesting they sometimes use hilly areas. They follow fires or herds of foraging ungulates, in order to pick their various foods out of the short grasses. They may also be found in cultivated areas, especially wheat fields with a few scattered trees. This bustard is not found in well-wooded and forested areas due to the fact that it needs a lot of open space in which to take off. In arid grassland areas it is found along dry watercourses where patches of trees offer shade during the heat of the day.</p>

using('ardeotis kori')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Kori Bustard is cryptically coloured, being mostly grey and brown, finely patterned with black and white coloring. The upper parts and neck are a vermiculated black and greyish-buff colour. The ventral plumage is more boldly colored, with white, black and buff. The crest on its head is blackish in coloration, with less black on the female's crest. There is a white eye stripe above the eye. The chin, throat and neck are whitish with thin, fine black barring. A black collar at the base of the hind-neck extends onto the sides of the breast. The feathers around the neck are loose, giving the appearance of a thicker neck then they really have. The belly is white and the tail has broad bands of brownish-gray and white coloration. Their feathers contain light sensitive porphyrins, which gives their feathers a pinkish tinge at the base- especially noticeable when the feathers are shed suddenly. The head is large and the legs are relatively long. The eye is pale yellow, while the bill is light greenish horn coloured, relatively long, straight and rather flattened at the base. The legs are yellowish. The feet have three forward facing toes. Females are similar in plumage but are much smaller, measuring about 20-30% less in linear measurements and often weighing 2-3 times less than the male. The female visibly is thinner legged and slimmer necked. The juvenile is similar in appearance to the female, but are browner with more spotting on the mantle, with shorter crest and neck plumes. Male juveniles are larger than females and can be the same overall size as the adult male but tends to be less bulky with a thinner neck, shorter head crest, paler eyes and a darker mantle.</p>

<p>Kori Bustards spend most of their time on the ground, with up to 70% of their time being on foot. Although, they can forage occasionally in low bushes and trees. There is a lone report of a bird sighted in Kenya perched at the top of a tree. This bustard is a watchful and wary bird. Their behavior varies however, and they are usually very shy, running or crouching at the first sign of danger; at other times they can be completely fearless of humans. They have a hesitant, slow manner of walking, and when they detect an intruder they try to escape detection by moving off quietly with the head held at an unusual angle of between 45&#xB0; and 60&#xB0;. Being a large and heavy bird, it avoids flying if possible. When alarmed it will first run and, if pushed further, will take to the air on the run with much effort, its wings making heavy wingbeats. Once airborne it flies more easily with slow, measured wingbeats, with the neck extended and the legs folded. It usually remains low and lands again within sight. When they land, Kori Bustards keep their wings spread and only fold them when the bird has slowed down to a walking speed. Kori Bustards have no preen gland, so to keep clean, they produce a powder down. Sun bathing and dust bathing are practiced. This bird has a loud, booming mating call which is often uttered just before dawn and can be heard from far away. Mostly residential, Kori Bustards may engage in nomadic movements. These migratory movements are probably influenced by rainfall and there is no evidence suggesting any regular pattern. These local migrations take place at night but have not been mapped. In the <span>Etosha National Park</span> these birds have been recorded moving up to 85 km (53 mi) from <span>mopane</span> woodland to open grassland plains and returning again the following season. Trial satellite tagging of one male Kori Bustard by the <span>National Museums of Kenya</span> demonstrated a migration along the <span>Rift Valley</span> between <span>Tanzania</span> and southern <span>Sudan</span>. Additionally, adult and juvenile males move after breeding season, whereas females don&#x2019;t appear to do so. Generally the Kori Bustard feeds during the morning and in the evening, spending the rest of the day standing still in any available shade.</p>

using('ardeotis kori')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Less vocal than other bustards, the Kori Bustard generally silent but, when alarmed, both sexes emit a loud growling bark. This is described as a <i>ca-caa-ca</i> call, repeated several times for up to 10 minutes. This call carries long distances. This call is most often given by females with young and males during agnostic encounters. Chicks as young as two weeks will also emit this alarm call when startled. The male's mating call is a deep, resonant <i>woum-woum-woum-woum</i> or <i>oom-oom-oom</i> or <i>wum, wum, wum, wum, wummm</i>. This call ends with the bill snapping which is only audible at close range. Outside of the breeding display, Kori Bustards are often silent. A high alarm call, generally uttered by females, is sometimes heard. They may utter a deep <i>vum</i> on takeoff.</p>

using('ardeotis kori')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>During the mating season, these birds are usually solitary but for the breeding pair. Otherwise, they are somewhat gregarious, being found in groups often including 5 to 6 birds but occasionally groups can number up to 40 individuals. Larger groups may be found around an abundant food source or at watering holes. In groups, birds are often fairly far apart from each other, often around a distance of 100 m (330 ft). Interestingly, foraging groups are often single-sex. Such groups do not last long and often separate after a few days. These groups are believed advantageous both in that they may insure safety in numbers against predation and may bring the bustards to prime food sources.</p>

using('ardeotis kori')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The female, who does all brooding behavior alone without male help, stays at the nest 98% of the time, rarely eating and never drinking. Occasionally she stretches her legs and raises her wings overhead. The female regularly turns the eggs with her bill. The female's plumage is drab and earth-colored, which makes her well camouflaged. She occasionally picks up pieces of vegetation and drops them on her back to render her camouflage more effective. If they need to feed briefly, the females go to and from the nest with a swift, silent crouching walk. If approached the incubating bird either slips unobtrusively from the nest or sits tight, only flying off at the last moment. The incubation period is 23 to 30 days, though is not known to exceed 25 days in wild specimens. The young are <span>precocial</span> and very well camouflaged. The lores are tawny, the crown tawny mottled black. A broad white supercilium bordered with black meets on the nape, extending down the centre of the nape. The neck is white with irregular black stripes from behind the eye and from the base of the lower mandibles. The upper parts are tawny and black with 3 black lines running along the back. The underparts are whitish. When the chicks hatch, the mother brings them a steady stream of food, most of it soft so the chicks can eat it easily. Captive hatchlings weigh 78 to 116 g (2.8 to 4.1 oz) on their first day but grow quickly. The precocial chicks are able to follow their mother around several hours after hatching. After a few weeks, the young actively forage closely with their mothers. They fledge at 4 to 5 weeks old, but are not self-assured fliers until 3 to 4 months. On average, around 67% of eggs successfully hatch (testimony to the effective camouflage of nests) and around one of the two young survive to adulthood. In <span>Namibia</span> and <span>Tanzania</span>, breeding success has been found to be greatly reduced during times of drought. Most young leave their mothers in their second year of life, but do not start breeding until they are fully mature at three to four years old in both sexes in studies conducted both of wild and captive bustards. The lifespan of wild Kori Bustards is not known but they may live to at least 26 or possibly 28 years old in captivity.</p>

<p>The Kori Bustard is generally a somewhat scarce bird. listed on Appendix II of CITES, and the 2000 Eskom Red Data Book for Birds lists the status of the nominate race as Vulnerable, estimating that in the next three generations, it is expected to decline by 10% in <span>South Africa</span>. In protected areas, they can be locally common. Viable populations exist in unprotected areas as well (e.g. <span>Ethiopia</span> and <span>Sudan</span>, and in <span>Tanzania</span> around <span>Lake Natron</span> and in the foothills of <span>Mount Kilimanjaro</span>) but in these areas, the birds are hunted. They have been much reduced by hunting, having been traditionally snared in <i>Acacia</i> gum baits and traps. Although no longer classified as game birds, they are still sometimes eaten. In <span>Namibia</span>, they indicated as game as they are called the &#x201C;Christmas turkey&#x201D; and in South Africa, the &#x201C;Kalahari Kentucky". Hunting of bustards is difficult to manage. The Kori Bustard is now generally uncommon outside major protected areas. Habitat destruction is a major problem for the species, compounded by bush encroachment due to overgrazing by livestock and agricultural development. Poisons used to control locusts may also effect and collisions with overhead power wires regularly claim Kori Bustards. One 10 km (6.2 mi) stretch of overhead powerlines in the <span>Karoo</span> killed 22 Kori Bustards during a five-month period. Kori Bustards tend to avoid areas used heavily by humans. Nonetheless, because it has such a large range and its rate of decline is thought to be relatively slow, the kori bustard is not currently listed in a threatened category on the IUCN Red List. This species is prominent in many native African cultures various due to its imposing, impressive size, spectacular displays by adult males and cryptic nature of the nesting female. The Kori Bustard features in dances and songs of the <span>San people</span> of <span>Botswana</span>. Paintings of these bustards feature in ancient San rock art.</p>

<p>Over much of its range, short-eared owls occurs with the similar-looking <span>long-eared owl</span>. At rest, the ear-tufts of long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owl can sometimes hold its ear-tufts flat). The iris-colour differs: yellow in short-eared, and orange in long-eared, and the black surrounding the eyes is vertical on long-eared, and horizontal on short-eared. Overall the short-eared tends to be a paler, sandier bird than the long-eared. There are a number of other ways in which the two species the differ which are best seen when they are flying: a) short-eared often has a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by long-eared; b) on the upperwing, short-eared owls' primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious; c) the band on the upper side of short-eared owl's tail are usually bolder than those of long-eared; d) short-eareds' innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing; e) the long-eared owl has streaking throughout its underparts whereas on short-eared the streaking ends at the breast; f) the dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on short-eared owl; g) the upperparts are coarsely blotched, whereas on long-eared they are more finely marked. The short-eared owl also differs structurally from the long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings: the long-eared owl has wings shaped more like those of a <span>tawny owl</span>. The long-eared owl generally has different habitat preferences from the short-eared, most often being found concealed in areas with dense wooded thickets. The short-eared owl is often most regularly seen flying about in early morning or late day as it hunts over open habitats.</p>

<p>The four-toed hedgehog is an oval-bodied animal between 15 and 25 centimetres (5.9 and 9.8 in) in length and weighing between 250 and 600 grams (8.8 and 21.2 oz). Females are typically larger than males. It has short legs, short tail typically around 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) in length, a long nose, and small beady eyes. The ears and whiskers are both relatively large, implying that the animal has good senses. As its common name implies, and unlike related species, the four-toed hedgehog typically has only four toes on each foot, lacking the <span>hallux</span>. However, in some individuals, a small bony lump may be present in place of the hallux, or there may even be a well-developed toe, especially on the hind feet.</p>

<p>The four-toed hedgehog is one of the most popular species of <span>domesticated hedgehog</span> sold in the exotic pet trade. It is bred extensively for color and temperament and is even displayed in competitive hedgehog shows. Lifespan is typically 4-6 years. Due to its energetic nature, many owners provide their hedgehog with a large running wheel. Some measure the distances their pets run every night, and some have claimed that their hedgehogs run upwards of 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) a night with speed bursts in excess of 16 kilometres per hour (9.9 mph). When kept in captivity, at more regulated temperatures, this species does not typically display its <span>estivation</span> or <span>hibernation</span> behaviour. Due to the large amount of breeding stock available in captive collections, the four-toed hedgehog is rarely imported from the wild any longer. Several <span>US</span> and <span>Canadian</span> localities ban ownership of this species, or require special permits for them. Hedgehogs are generally hardy animals when kept properly, though they may be vulnerable to the growth of tumors as they mature.</p>

<p>The <b>African brush-tailed porcupine</b> (<i>Atherurus africanus</i>) is a species of <span>rat</span>-like <span>Old World porcupines</span> called "<span>brush-tailed porcupines</span>". The brush-tailed porcupines live in forests, usually at high elevations. They are <span>nocturnal</span> and during the day they sleep in <span>caves</span> and burrows. The brush-tailed porcupine is one of the biggest <span>rodents</span> in <span>Africa</span>, with a body length of 36-60 cm (14-24 in), discounting a tail of about 10-26 cm (4-10 in) and weigh as much as 2.9 kg (6.4 lb). It has an elongated rat-like face and body and short legs, tipped with clawed and webbed feet. Unlike most other porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine has lighter and smaller quills. On the tail, these quills are thinner and brush-like. These can make noise when rattled. Brush-tailed porcupines live in small family groups of about eight members. Different family groups can share resources. When attacked by a <span>predator</span>, the porcupine raises its quills so it looks twice its size, rattles its tail quills, and stomps its feet. As with all porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine backs into the attacker and inflicts damage with its quills.</p>

An intelligent creature, the marsh mongoose has been observed throwing <span>crabs</span> and snails against rocks in order to break open the shells. Some accounts claim that the Marsh Mongoose will sometimes lie very still, its tail up, and that in this position, the pink anal region makes a startling contrast against the dark fur, which induces birds to come near and peck at it; when the birds come near, they are killed and consumed.</p>

<p>The shoebill is a tall bird, with a typical height range of 110 to 140 cm (43 to 55 in) and some specimens reaching as much as 152 cm (60 in). Length from tail to beak can range from 100 to 140 cm (39 to 55 in) and wingspan is 230 to 260 cm (7 ft 7 in to 8 ft 6 in). Weight has reportedly ranged from 4 to 7 kg (8.8 to 15.4 lb). A male will weigh on average around 5.6 kg (12 lb) and is larger than a typical female of 4.9 kg (11 lb). The signature feature of the species is its huge, bulbous <span>bill</span>, which is straw-coloured with erratic greyish markings. The <span>exposed culmen</span> (or the measurement along the top of the upper mandible) is 18.8 to 24 cm (7.4 to 9.4 in). The sharp edges in the mandibles help the shoebill to decapitate their prey and also to discard any vegetation after prey has been caught. As in the <span>pelicans</span>, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail. The dark coloured legs are fairly long, with a <span>tarsus</span> length of 21.7 to 25.5 cm (8.5 to 10.0 in). The shoebill's feet are exceptionally large, with the middle toe reaching 16.8 to 18.5 cm (6.6 to 7.3 in) in length, likely assisting the species in its ability to stand on aquatic vegetation while hunting. The neck is relatively shorter and thicker than other long-legged wading birds such as <span>herons</span> and <span>cranes</span>. The wings are broad, with a <span>wing chord</span> length of 58.8 to 78 cm (23.1 to 30.7 in), and well-adapted to <span>soaring</span>.</p>

<p>Its wings are held flat while soaring and, as in the pelicans and the storks of the genus <i><span>Leptoptilos</span></i>, the shoebill flies with its neck retracted. Its flapping rate, at an estimated 150 flaps per minute, is one the slowest of any bird, with the exception of the larger <span>stork</span> species. The pattern is alternating flapping and gliding cycles of approximately seven seconds each, putting its gliding distance somewhere between the larger storks and the <span>Andean condor</span> (<i>Vultur gryphus</i>). When flushed, shoebills usually try to fly no more than 100 to 500 m (330 to 1,640 ft) from their prior location. Long flights of the shoebill are rare, and only a few flights beyond its minimum foraging distance of 20 m (66 ft) have been captured.</p>

<p>The shoebill is noted for its slow movements and tendency to remain still for long periods, resulting in repeated descriptions of the species as "statue-like". They are quite sensitive to human disturbance and may abandon their nests if flushed by humans. However, while foraging, if dense vegetation stands between it and humans, this wader can be fairly tame. The shoebill is attracted to poorly oxygenated waters where fish frequently surface to breathe. Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant <span>jacana</span>, although the similarly-sized and occasionally sympatric <span>Goliath heron</span> (<i>Ardea goliath</i>) is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation. Shoebills typically feed in muddy waters and, being solitary birds, forage at a minimum distance of 20 m (66 ft) from one another even where relatively densely populated. This species stalks its prey patiently, in a slow and lurking fashion. While hunting, the shoebill strides very slowly and is frequently motionless. Unlike some other large waders, this species hunts entirely using vision and is not known to engage in <span>tactile</span> hunting. When prey is spotted, it launches a quick, violent strike. However, depending on the size of the prey, handling time after the strike can exceed 10 minutes. Around 60% of strikes are successful in yielding prey. Frequently water and vegetation is snatched up during the strike and is spilled out from the edges of the mandibles. Occasionally, the activity of <span>hippopotamus</span> may inadvertently benefit the shoebill, as the huge mammals occasionally force fish to the surface of the water while they are submerged.</p>

<p>Shoebills are largely <span>piscivorous</span> but are assured predators of a considerable range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included <span>marbled lungfish</span> (<i>Protopterus aethiopicus</i>) and <span>Senegal bichir</span> (<i>Polypterus senegalus</i>) as well as various <i><span>Tilapia</span></i> species and <span>catfish</span>, the latter mainly in the genus <i><span>Clarias</span></i>. Other prey eaten by this species has included <span>frogs</span>, water <span>snakes</span>, <span>Nile monitors</span> (<i>Varanus niloticus</i>) and baby <span>crocodiles</span>. More rarely, <span>turtles</span>, <span>snails</span>, <span>rodents</span> and small <span>waterfowl</span> have reportedly been eaten. There exists a single report of shoebills feeding on <span>lechwe</span> (<i>Kobus leche</i>) calves, although this would need confirmation. Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than other large wading birds. Fish eaten by this species are commonly in the range of 15 to 50 cm (5.9 to 19.7 in) long and weigh around 500 g (1.1 lb), though lungfish of as much as 1 m (3.3 ft) have been attacked. Snakes preyed upon are commonly from 50 to 60 cm (20 to 24 in) long.

<p>Like their close relative the common minke, the Antarctic minke whale is robust for its genus. They have a narrow, pointed, triangular rostrum with a low splashguard. Their prominent, upright, falcate dorsal fin - often more curved and pointed than in common minkes -is set about two-thirds the way along the back. About half of individuals have a light gray flare or patch on the posterior half of the dorsal fin, similar to that seen in species of <span>dolphins</span> in the genus <i><span>Lagenorhynchus</span></i>. They are dark gray dorsally and clean white ventrally. The lower jaw projects beyond the upper jaw and is dark gray on both sides. Antarctic minkes lack the light gray <i>rostral saddle</i> present in the common and dwarf forms. All individuals possess pale, thin <i>blowhole streaks</i> trailing from the blowhole slits, which first veer left and then right - particularly the right streak. These streaks appear to be more prominent and consistent on this species than on either the common or dwarf minke. Most also have a variably colored - light gray, light gray with dark edges, or simply dark - <i>ear streak</i> trailing behind the opening for the <span>auditory meatus</span>, which widens and becomes more diffuse posteriorly. A light gray variably shaped <i>double chevron</i> or W-shaped pattern (analogous to a similar pattern seen on their larger cousin the <span>fin whale</span>) lies between the flippers. This broadens to form a light gray <i>shoulder patch</i> above the flippers. Like common and dwarf minkes, they have two light gray to whitish swaths, called the <i>thorax</i> and <i>flank patches</i>, the former running diagonally up from the <span>axilla</span> and diagonally down again to form a triangular intrusion into the dark gray of the thorax and the latter rising more vertically along its anterior edge and extending further dorsally before gradually sloping posteriorly to merge with the white of the ventral side of the caudal peduncle. A dark gray, roughly triangular <i>thorax field</i> separates the two, while a narrower dark gray <i>shoulder infill</i> separates the thorax patch from the shoulder patch. Two light gray, forward directed <i>caudal chevrons</i> extend from the dark gray field above, forming a whitish <i>peduncle blaze</i> between them. The smooth sided flukes, usually about 2.6 to 2.73 m (8.5 to 9 ft) wide, are dark gray dorsally and clean white (occasionally light gray to gray) ventrally with a thin, dusky margin. Some small, dark gray <i>speckling</i> may be present on the body.</p>

<p>The longest baleen plates average 25 to 27 cm (10 to 10.5 inches) in length and about 12.5 to 13.5 cm (5 to 5.3 inches) in breadth and number 155 to 415 pairs (average 273). They are two-toned, with a dark gray outer margin on the posterior plates and a white outer margin on the anterior plates - though there may be some rows of dark plates amongst the white plates. There is a degree of asymmetry, with a smaller number of white plates on the left side than on the right (12% on average for the left versus 34% on average for the right). The dark gray border occupies about one third of the width of the plates (ranging from about one-seventh to over half of its width), with the average width being greater on the left side than on the right. In contrast, dwarf minkes have smaller baleen plates of only 20 cm (8 in) in length, have a greater number of white plates (over 54%, often 100%) that lack this asymmetrical coloration, and have a narrow dark gray border (when present) of less than 6% of the width of the plate. Antarctic minkes have an average of 42 to 44 thin, narrow ventral grooves (range 32 to 70) that extend to about 48% of the length of the body - well short of the umbilicus.</p>

<p>Unlike common minke whales, they often have a prominent blow, which is particularly visible in the calmer waters near the pack ice. In the narrow holes and cracks in the pack ice they have been observed spyhopping - raising their head vertically - to expose their blowholes to breathe; individuals have even been seen to break breathing holes through sea ice in the winter (July-August), rising in a similar manner. When traveling fast in open water they can create larger versions of the "roostertail" of spray created by their smaller cousin, the <span>Dall's porpoise</span>. During bouts of feeding they will lunge multiple times onto their side (either left or right) into a dense patch of prey with mouth agape and ventral pleats expanded as their gular pouch fills with prey-laden water. After making a series of shorter dives during which they will surface anywhere from two to fifteen times, they will make a longer dive of up fourteen minutes. Shallower dives of normally less than 40 m (131 ft) are made at night (from about 8 p.m. to about 2 a.m.) while deeper dives that can be over 100 m (328 ft) deep are made during the day (from about 2 a.m. to about 8 p.m.).</p>

<p>During the commercial whaling era, from 1950-51 to 1986-87, 97,866 minke whales (the vast majority probably Antarctic minkes) were caught in the Southern Ocean - mainly by the Japanese and Soviets - with a peak of 7,900 being reached in 1976-77. Harpoon guns of lesser caliber and "cold harpoons" (harpoons without explosive shells) had to be used due to their small size, while no air was pumped into the carcasses when they were tied alongside for towing to ensure the greatest quality of meat. While an expedition or two was fitted out each year specifically for minke whales - the <i>Jinyo Maru</i> in 1971-72, the <i>Chiyo Maru</i> from 1972-73 to 1974-75, and the <i>Kyokusei Maru</i> in 1973-74 - most expeditions, which targeted other species, ignored minkes during the peak of the whaling season (November-December and late February to early March) and only caught them on whaling grounds relatively close to those of larger ones - the minke whaling grounds were much further south (south of 60&#xB0; S) than those for fin and sei whales.</p>

<p>Reaching 19.5 metres (64 ft) long and weighing as much as 28 tonnes (28 long tons; 31 short tons), the sei whale daily consumes an average of 900 kilograms (2,000 lb) of food, primarily <span>copepods</span>, <span>krill</span>, and other <span>zooplankton</span>. It is among the fastest of all <span>cetaceans</span>, and can reach speeds of up to 50 kilometres per hour (31 mph) (27 <span>knots</span>) over short distances. The whale's name comes from the <span>Norwegian</span> word for <span>pollock</span>, a fish that appears off the coast of Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale.</p>

<p><i>Sei</i> is the Norwegian word for <span>pollock</span>, also referred to as coalfish, a close relative of codfish. Sei whales appeared off the coast of Norway at the same time as the pollock, both coming to feed on the abundant <span>plankton</span>. The specific name is the Latin word <i>borealis</i>, meaning northern. In the Pacific, the whale has been called the Japan finner; "finner" was a common term used to refer to rorquals. In Japanese, the whale was called <i>iwashi kujira</i>, or sardine whale, a name originally applied to <span>Bryde's whales</span> by early Japanese whalers. Later, as modern whaling shifted to <span>Sanriku</span> &#x2014; where both species occur &#x2014; it was confused for the sei whale. Now the term only applies to the latter species. It has also been referred to as the <b>lesser fin whale</b> because it somewhat resembles the fin whale. The American <span>naturalist</span> <span>Roy Chapman Andrews</span> compared the sei whale to the <span>cheetah</span>, because it can swim at great speeds "for a few hundred yards", but it "soon tires if the chase is long" and "does not have the strength and staying power of its larger relatives".</p>

<p>On 21 February 1819, a 32-ft whale stranded near <span>Gr&#xF6;mitz</span>, in <span>Schleswig-Holstein</span>. The Swedish-born German naturalist Karl Rudolphi initially identified it as <i>Balaena rostrata</i> (=<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>). In 1823, the French naturalist <span>Georges Cuvier</span> described and figured Rudolphi's specimen under the name "rorqual du Nord". In 1828, Rene Lesson translated this term into <i>Balaenoptera borealis</i>, basing his designation partly on Cuvier's description of Rudolphi's specimen and partly on a 54-ft female that had stranded on the coast of France the previous year (this was later identified as a juvenile fin whale, <i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>). In 1846, the English zoologist <span>John Edward Gray</span>, ignoring Lesson's designation, named Rudolphi's specimen <i>Balaenoptera laticeps</i>, which others followed. In 1865, the British zoologist <span>William Henry Flower</span> named a 45-ft specimen that had been obtained from <span>Pekalongan</span>, on the north coast of <span>Java</span>, <i>Sibbaldius</i> (=<i>Balaenoptera</i>) <i>schlegelii</i> &#x2014; in 1946 the Russian scientist A.G. Tomilin synonymized <i>S. schlegelii</i> and <i>B. borealis</i>, creating the subspecies <i>B. b. schlegelii</i> and <i>B. b. borealis</i>. In 1884-85, the Norwegian scientist G. A. Guldberg first identified the "sejhval" of <span>Finnmark</span> with <i>B. borealis</i>.</p>

<p>Sei whales are <span>rorquals</span> (family Balaenopteridae), baleen whales that include the <span>humpback whale</span>, the <span>blue whale</span>, the <span>Bryde's whale</span>, the <span>fin whale</span>, and the <span>minke whale</span>. Rorquals take their name from the <span>Norwegian</span> word <i>r&#xF8;yrkval</i>, meaning "furrow whale", because family members have a series of longitudinal pleats or grooves on the anterior half of their ventral surface. Balaenopterids diverged from the other families of suborder <span>Mysticeti</span>, also called the whalebone whales or great whales, as long ago as the middle <span>Miocene</span>. Little is known about when members of the various families in the Mysticeti, including the Balaenopteridae, diverged from each other.</p>

<p>The sei whale is the third-largest balaenopterid, after the blue whale (up to 180 tonnes, 200 tons) and the fin whale (up to 70 tonnes, 77 tons). In the North Pacific, adult males average 13.7 m (45 ft) and adult females 15 m (49 ft), while in the North Atlantic adult males average 14 m (46 ft) and adult females 14.5 m (47.5 ft). In the Southern Hemisphere they average 14.5 (47.5 ft) and 15 m (49 ft), respectively. In the Northern Hemisphere, males reach up to 17.1 m (56 ft) and females up to 18.6 m (61 ft), while in the Southern Hemisphere males reach 18.6 m (61 ft) and females 19.5 m (64 ft) &#x2014; the authenticity of an alleged 22 m (72 ft) female caught fifty miles northwest of <span>St. Kilda</span> in July 1911 is doubted. The largest specimens taken off <span>Iceland</span> were a 16.15 m (53 ft) female and a 14.6 m (48 ft) male, while the longest off Nova Scotia were two 15.8 m (52 ft) females and a 15.2 m (50 ft) male. The longest measured during JARPN II cruises in the North Pacific were a 16.32 m (53.5 ft) female and a 15 m (49 ft) male. The longest measured by Discovery Committee staff were an adult male of 16.15 m (53 ft) and an adult female of 17.1 m (56 ft), both caught off South Georgia. Adults usually weigh between 15 and 20 metric tons &#x2014; a 16.4 m (53.7 ft) pregnant female caught off Natal in 1966 weighed 37.75 metric tons (minus 6% for loss of fluids during flensing). Females are considerably larger than males. At birth, a calf typically measures 4.4-4.5 m (14.4-14.7 ft) in length.</p>

<p>The whale's body is typically a dark steel grey with irregular light grey to white markings on the <span>ventral</span> surface, or towards the front of the lower body. The whale has a relatively short series of 32-60 <span>pleats</span> or grooves along its ventral surface that extend halfway between the pectoral fins and umbilicus (in other species it usually extends to or past the umbilicus), restricting the expansion of the buccal cavity during feeding compared to other species. The <span>rostrum</span> is pointed and the <span>pectoral fins</span> are relatively short, only 9%-10% of body length, and pointed at the tips. It has a single ridge extending from the tip of the rostrum to the paired <span>blowholes</span> that are a distinctive characteristic of baleen whales.</p>

<p>Adults have 300-380 ashy-black baleen plates on each side of the mouth, up to 80 centimetres (31 in) long. Each plate is made of <span>fingernail</span>-like <span>keratin</span>, which is bordered by a fringe of very fine, short, curly, wool-like white bristles. The sei's very fine baleen bristles, about 0.1 millimetres (0.004 in) are the most reliable characteristic that distinguishes it from other rorquals.</p>

<p>In the <span>North Atlantic</span>, it feeds primarily on <span>calanoid copepods</span>, specifically <i>Calanus finmarchicus</i>, with a secondary preference for <span>euphausiids</span>, in particular <i>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</i> and <i>Thysanoessa inermis</i>. In the <span>North Pacific</span>, it feeds on similar zooplankton, including the copepod species <i>Neocalanus cristatus</i>, <i>N. plumchrus</i>, and <i>Calanus pacificus</i>, and euphausiid species <i>Euphausia pacifica</i>, <i>E. similis</i>, <i>Thysanoessa inermis</i>, <i>T. longipes</i>, <i>T. gregaria</i> and <i>T. spinifera</i>. In addition, it eats larger organisms, such as the <span>Japanese flying squid</span>, <i>Todarodes pacificus pacificus</i>, and small fish, including <span>anchovies</span> (<i>Engraulis japonicus</i> and <i>E. mordax</i>), <span>sardines</span> (<i>Sardinops sagax</i>), <span>Pacific saury</span> (<i>Cololabis saira</i>), <span>mackerel</span> (<i>Scomber japonicus</i> and <i>S. australasicus</i>), <span>jack mackerel</span> (<i>Trachurus symmetricus</i>) and juvenile <span>rockfish</span> (<i>Sebastes jordani</i>). Some of these fish are commercially important. Off central <span>California</span>, they mainly feed on anchovies between June and August, and on <span>krill</span> (<i>Euphausia pacifica</i>) during September and October. In the Southern Hemisphere, prey species include the copepods <i>Neocalanus tonsus</i>, <i>Calanus simillimus</i>, and <i>Drepanopus pectinatus</i>, as well as the euphausiids <i>Euphausia superba</i> and <i>Euphausia vallentini</i> and the pelagic <span>amphipod</span> <i><span>Themisto gaudichaudii</span></i>.</p>

<p>A newborn is <span>weaned</span> from its mother at 6-9 months of age, when it is 8-9 metres (26-30 ft) long, so weaning takes place at the summer or autumn feeding grounds. Females reproduce every 2-3 years, usually to a single calf. In the Northern Hemisphere, males are usually 12.8-12.9 m (42-42.3 ft) and females 13.3-13.4 m (43.6-44 ft) at sexual maturity, while in the Southern Hemisphere males average 13.6 m (44.6 ft) and females 14 m (46 ft). The average age of <span>sexual maturity</span> of both <span>sexes</span> is 8-10 years. The whales can reach ages of up to 65 years.</p>

<p>The sei whale makes long, loud, low-frequency sounds. Relatively little is known about specific calls, but in 2003, observers noted sei whale calls in addition to sounds that could be described as "growls" or "whooshes" off the coast of the <span>Antarctic Peninsula</span>. Many calls consisted of multiple parts at different frequencies. This combination distinguishes their calls from those of other whales. Most calls lasted about a half second, and occurred in the 240-625 <span>hertz</span> range, well within the range of human hearing. The maximum volume of the vocal sequences is reported as 156 <span>decibels</span> relative to 1 <span>micropascal (&#x3BC;Pa)</span> at a reference distance of one metre. An observer situated one metre from a vocalizing whale would perceive a volume roughly equivalent to the volume of a jackhammer operating two metres away.</p>

<p>In the North Atlantic, its range extends from <span>southern Europe</span> or <span>northwestern Africa</span> to Norway, and from the <span>southern United States</span> to <span>Greenland</span>. The southernmost confirmed records are strandings along the northern <span>Gulf of Mexico</span> and in the <span>Greater Antilles</span>. Throughout its range, the whale tends to avoid semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the <span>Gulf of Saint Lawrence</span>, <span>Hudson Bay</span>, the <span>North Sea</span>, and the <span>Mediterranean Sea</span>. It occurs predominantly in deep water, occurring most commonly over the <span>continental slope</span>, in basins situated between banks, or <span>submarine canyon</span> areas.</p>

using('balaenoptera borealis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In general, the sei whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and subtropical waters for winter, where food is more abundant. In the northwest Atlantic, sightings and catch records suggest the whales move north along the shelf edge to arrive in the areas of <span>Georges Bank</span>, <span>Northeast Channel</span>, and <span>Browns Bank</span> by mid to late June. They are present off the south coast of <span>Newfoundland</span> in August and September, and a southbound migration begins moving west and south along the <span>Nova Scotian</span> shelf from mid-September to mid-November. Whales in the <span>Labrador Sea</span> as early as the first week of June may move farther northward to waters southwest of <span>Greenland</span> later in the summer. In the northeast Atlantic, the sei whale winters as far south as <span>West Africa</span> such as off <span>Bay of Arguin</span>, off <span>coastal Western Sahara</span> and follows the continental slope northward in spring. Large females lead the northward migration and reach the <span>Denmark Strait</span> earlier and more reliably than other sexes and classes, arriving in mid-July and remaining through mid-September. In some years, males and younger females remain at lower latitudes during the summer months.</p>

<p>In 1878, the Scottish zoologist <span>John Anderson</span>, first curator of the <span>Indian Museum</span> in <span>Calcutta</span>, described <i>Balaenoptera edeni</i>, naming it after the former British High Commissioner in <span>Burma</span>, Sir <span>Ashley Eden</span>, who helped obtain the type specimen. Eden's Deputy Commissioner, Major A.G. Duff, sent a Mr. Duke, one of his assistants, to Thaybyoo Creek, between the <span>Sittang</span> and Beeling rivers, on the <span>Gulf of Martaban</span>, where he found a 37-ft whale, which had stranded there in June 1871 after swimming more than twenty miles up the creek &#x2014; it was said to have "exhausted itself by its furious struggles" to get free and "roared like an elephant" before finally expiring. Despite terrible weather, he was able to secure almost the entire skull as well as nearly all its vertebrae, along with other bones. These were sent to Anderson, who described the specimen, which was physically mature, as a new species. In 1913, the Norwegian scientist &#xD8;rjan Olsen, based on the examination of a dozen "sei whales" brought to the whaling stations at <span>Durban</span> and <span>Saldanha</span>, in <span>South Africa</span>, described <i>Balaenoptera brydei</i>, naming it after the Norwegian consul to South Africa Johan Bryde. In 1950, the Dutch scientist G.C.A. Junge, after comparing specimens of <i>B. edeni</i> and <i>B. brydei</i> with a 39-ft physically mature specimen that had stranded on Pulu Sugi, an island between <span>Singapore</span> and <span>Sumatra</span>, in July 1936, synonymized the two species into <i>B. edeni</i> (Anderson, 1878).</p>

<p>Members of the Bryde's whale complex are moderately-sized <span>rorquals</span>, falling behind <span>sei whales</span> but being larger than Omura's whale and the relatively small <span>minke whales</span>. The largest measured by Olsen (1913) was a 14.95 m (49 ft) female caught off Durban in November 1912, while the longest of each sex measured by Best (1977) at the Donkergat whaling station in <span>Saldanha Bay</span>, South Africa, were a 15.51 m (50.9 ft) female caught in October 1962 and a 14.56 m (47.8 ft) male caught in April 1963 - both were the offshore form. At physical maturity, the coastal form off South Africa averages 13.1 m (43 ft) for males and 13.7 m (45 ft) for females, while the South Africa offshore form averages 13.7 m (45 ft) and 14.4 m (47.2 ft). The coastal form off Japan is slightly smaller, with adult males averaging 12.9 m (42.3 ft) and adult females 13.3 m (43.6 ft). At sexual maturity, males average 11.9 m (39 ft) and females 12 m (39.3 ft) off Japan. Sexual maturity is reached at 8-11 years for both sexes in the offshore form off South Africa. At birth, they are 3.95-4.15 m (13-13.5 ft). The body mass of Bryde's whales can range from 12 to 25 metric tons (13 to 28 short tons).</p>

using('balaenoptera brydei')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Bryde's whale is a <span>baleen</span> whale, more specifically a <span>rorqual</span> belonging to the same group as <span>blue whales</span> and <span>humpback whales</span>. It has twin blowholes with a low splashguard to the front. Like other rorquals, it has no teeth, but has two rows of baleen plates.</p>

using('balaenoptera brydei')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Bryde's whales closely resemble their close relative the <span>sei whale</span>. They are remarkably elongated (even more so than <span>fin whales</span>), with the greatest height of the body being 1/7 their total length - compared to 1/6.5 to 1/6.75 in fin whales and only 1/5.5 in sei whales. Bryde's are dark smoky gray dorsally and usually white ventrally, whereas sei whales are often a galvanized blue-gray dorsally and have a variably sized white patch on the throat, a posteriorly oriented white anchor-shaped marking between the pectoral fins, and are blue-gray beyond the anus - although Bryde's off South Africa can have a similar irregular white patch on the throat. Bryde's have a straight rostrum with three longitudinal ridges that extend from the blowholes, where the auxiliary ridges begin as depressions, to the tip of the rostrum. The sei whale, like other rorquals, has a single median ridge, as well as a slightly arched rostrum, which is accentuated at the tip. Bryde's usually have dark gray lower jaws, whereas sei whales are lighter gray. Bryde's have 250-370 pairs of short, slate gray baleen plates with long, coarse, lighter gray or white bristles that are 40 centimetres (16 in) long by 20 centimetres (7.9 in) wide, while sei whales have longer, black or dark gray baleen plates with short, curling, wool-like bristles.</p>

using('balaenoptera brydei')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Bryde's have an upright, falcate dorsal fin that is up to 46.25 cm (18.5 in) in height, averages 34.4 cm (13.75 in), and is usually between 30 and 37.5 cm (12 and 15 in). It is often frayed or ragged along its rear margin and located about two-thirds the way along the back. The broad, centrally notched tail flukes never break the surface. The flippers are small and slender.</p>

using('balaenoptera brydei')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Bryde's whales breed in alternate years, apparently in any season, with an autumnal peak. Their gestation period is estimated at 12 months. Calves are about 11-13 feet (3.4-4.0 m) long at birth and weigh 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb). They become sexually mature at 8-13 years of age, when females are 39 feet (12 m). The mother nurses for 6-12 months.</p>

<p><i>B. brydei</i> occurs in the <span>Atlantic</span>, <span>Pacific</span>, and <span>Indian</span> oceans between the 40th parallels of latitude, preferring highly productive tropical, subtropical and warm temperate waters of 61-72 &#xB0;F (16-22 &#xB0;C). In the North Pacific, they occur as far north as <span>Honshu</span> to the west and southern <span>California</span> in the east, with vagrants reported as far north as <span>Washington State</span> in the <span>United States</span>. There is a resident population in the <span>Gulf of California</span> and they occur throughout the eastern tropical Pacific, including <span>Peru</span> and <span>Ecuador</span>, where they are absent from July to September. They have also been reported in an upwelling area off <span>Chile</span> between 35&#xB0; and 37&#xB0;S. In the southwestern Pacific, they occur as far south as the <span>North Island</span> of <span>New Zealand</span>. Based on osteological features a specimen from <span>Taiwan</span> was referred to <i>B. brydei</i>, while several specimens from the <span>Philippines</span> and <span>Indonesia</span> differed slightly in skull morphology and were referred to the putative Indo-Pacific Bryde's whale. Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed that Bryde's whales caught in the pelagic western North Pacific and <span>Bonin Islands</span> (resident population exists), as well as biopsy samples taken from whales off <span>Hawaii</span>, the west coast of Baja California, and the southern Gulf of California, belonged to <i>B. brydei</i>.</p>

<p>The first published description of the blue whale comes from <span>Robert Sibbald</span>'s <i>Phalainologia Nova</i> (1694). In September 1692, Sibbald found a blue whale that had stranded in the <span>Firth of Forth</span>&#x2014;a male 24 m (78 ft)-long&#x2014;which had "black, horny plates" and "two large apertures approaching a pyramid in shape".</p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales. The head is flat, <i>U</i>-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the <span>blowhole</span> to the top of the upper lip. The front part of the mouth is thick with <span>baleen</span> plates; around 300 plates (each around one metre (3.2 ft) long) hang from the upper jaw, running 0.5 m (1.6 ft) back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see feeding below).</p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The <span>dorsal fin</span> is small, ranging in height from 8-70 centimeters (3.1-27.6 in) (usually 20-40 centimeters (7.9-15.7 in)) and averaging about 28 centimetres (11 in). It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a spectacular vertical single-column spout up to 12 metres (39 ft), typically 9 metres (30 ft). Its <span>lung</span> capacity is 5,000 litres (1320 U.S. gallons). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.</p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The flippers are 3-4 metres (9.8-13.1 ft) long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.</p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.</p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. As is the case with most large whales targeted by whalers, adult blue whales have never been weighed whole, but cut up into manageable pieces first. This caused an underestimate of the total weight of the whale, due to the loss of blood and other fluids. As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific appear to be smaller on average than those from sub-Antarctic waters. Nevertheless, measurements between 150-170 tonnes (170-190 short tons) were recorded of animals up to 27 metres (89 ft) in length. The weight of an individual 30 metres (98 ft) long is believed by the American <span>National Marine Mammal Laboratory</span> (NMML) to be in excess of 180 tonnes (200 short tons).

<p>There is some uncertainty about the biggest blue whale ever found, as most data came from blue whales killed in <span>Antarctic</span> waters during the first half of the twentieth century, which were collected by whalers not well-versed in standard zoological measurement techniques. The heaviest whale ever recorded weighed in at approximately 190 metric tons (210 short tons). The longest whales ever recorded were two females measuring 33.6 and 33.3 metres (110 and 109 ft), although in neither of these cases was the piecemeal weight gathered. The longest whale measured by scientists at the NMML was a 29.9 metres (98 ft), female caught in the Antarctic by Japanese whalers in 1946-47. Lieut. Quentin R. Walsh, USCG, while acting as whaling inspector of the factory ship <i>Ulysses</i>, verified the measurement of a 30 m (98 ft) pregnant blue whale caught in the Antarctic in the 1937-38 season. The longest reported in the North Pacific was a 27.1 metres (89 ft) female taken by Japanese whalers in 1959, and the longest reported in the North Atlantic was a 28.1 metres (92 ft) female caught in the Davis Strait.</p>

<p>Blue whales feed almost exclusively on <span>krill</span>, though they also take small numbers of <span>copepods</span>. The species of this <span>zooplankton</span> eaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, <i><span>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa raschii</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa inermis</span></i> and <i><span>Thysanoessa longicaudata</span></i> are the usual food; in the North Pacific, <i><span>Euphausia pacifica</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa inermis</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa longipes</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa spinifera</span></i>, <i><span>Nyctiphanes symplex</span></i> and <i><span>Nematoscelis megalops</span></i>; and in the Southern Hemisphere, <i><span>Euphausia superba</span></i>, <i><span>Euphausia crystallorophias</span></i>, <i><span>Euphausia valentini</span></i>, and <i><span>Nyctiphanes australis</span>.</i></p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than 100 metres (330 ft) during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10 minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 20 minutes are common. The longest recorded dive is 36 minutes. The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.</p>

using('balaenoptera musculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Scientists estimate that blue whales can live for at least 80 years, but since individual records do not date back into the whaling era, this will not be known with certainty for many years. The longest recorded study of a single individual is 34 years, in the eastern North Pacific. The whales' only natural predator is the <span>orca</span>. Studies report that as many as 25% of mature blue whales have scars resulting from orca attacks. The mortality rate of such attacks is unknown.</p>

<p>In the North Atlantic, two stocks of <i>B. m. musculus</i> are recognised. The first is found off <span>Greenland</span>, <span>Newfoundland</span>, Nova Scotia and the <span>Gulf of Saint Lawrence</span>. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the <span>Azores</span> in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the <span>Mid-Atlantic Ridge</span> between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north as <span>Spitsbergen</span> and <span>Jan Mayen</span>, though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500. Off <span>Ireland</span>, the first ever confirmed sightings were made in 2008, since then <span>Porcupine Seabight</span> has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with Fin Whales.</p>

<p>Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean (<span>Oman</span>, Maldives and <span>Sri Lanka</span>), where they may form a distinct resident population. In addition, the population of blue whales occurring off <span>Chile</span> and <span>Peru</span> may also be a distinct population. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean. In Chile, the <span>Cetacean Conservation Center</span>, with support from the <span>Chilean Navy</span>, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of <span>Chiloe Island</span> in the <span>Gulf of Corcovado</span>(<span>Chilo&#xE9; National Park</span>), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007. In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enter <span>Fiords</span>. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as off <span>Caleta Zorra</span>, live along with other rorquals.</p>

<p>In <span>Chile</span>, the <span>Alfaguara project</span> combines conservation measures for the population of blue whales feeding off <span>Chilo&#xE9; Island</span> with whale watching and other ecotourism activities that bring economic benefits to the local people.

<p>The <b>fin whale</b> (<i>Balaenoptera physalus</i>), also called the <b>finback whale</b>, <b>razorback</b>, or <b>common rorqual</b>, is a marine <span>mammal</span> belonging to the suborder of <span>baleen whales</span>. It is the second longest <span>animal</span> in the world and second largest <span>rorqual</span> after the <span>blue whale</span>, growing to 27.3 metres (89.5 ft) long and weighing nearly 74 tonnes (73 long tons; 82 short tons). The <span>American</span> <span>naturalist</span> <span>Roy Chapman Andrews</span> called the fin whale "the greyhound of the sea... for its beautiful, slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship."</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Long and slender, the fin whale's body is brownish-grey with a paler underside. At least two recognized subspecies exist: the North Atlantic and the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span>. It is found in all the major oceans, from <span>polar</span> to <span>tropical</span> waters. It is absent only from waters close to the <span>ice pack</span> at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in <span>temperate</span> and cool waters. Its food consists of small <span>schooling</span> fish, <span>squid</span>, and <span>crustaceans</span> including <span>copepods</span> and <span>krill</span>.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Fin whales are <span>rorquals</span>, members of the family <span>Balaenopteridae</span>, which also includes the <span>humpback whale</span>, the <span>blue whale</span>, the <span>Bryde's whale</span>, the <span>sei whale</span> and the <span>minke whale</span>. The family diverged from the other <span>baleen whales</span> in the suborder <span>Mysticeti</span> as long ago as the middle <span>Miocene</span>, although it is not known when the members of these families further evolved into their own species.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The fin whale is usually distinguished by its tall spout, long back, prominent <span>dorsal fin</span>, and asymmetrical coloration.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the North Atlantic, the longest reported were a 24.4 metres (80 ft) male caught off the Shetland Islands in 1905 and a 25 metres (82 ft) female caught off Scotland sometime between 1908 and 1914, while the longest reliably measured were three 20.7 metres (68 ft) males caught off Iceland in 1973-74 and a 22.5 metres (74 ft) female also caught off Iceland in 1975.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the North Pacific, the longest reported were three 22.9 metres (75 ft) males, two caught off California between 1919 and 1926 and the other caught off Alaska in 1925, and a 24.7 metres (81 ft) female also caught off California, while the longest reliably measured were a 21 metres (69 ft) male caught off British Columbia in 1959 and a 22.9 metres (75 ft) female caught off central California between 1959 and 1970.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere, the longest reported for each sex were 25 metres (82 ft) and 27.3 m (89.5 ft), while the longest measured by Mackintosh and Wheeler (1929) were 22.65 metres (74.3 ft) and 24.53 metres (80.5 ft). Major F. A. Spencer, while whaling inspector of the factory ship <i>Southern Princess</i> (1936-38), confirmed the length of a 25.9 metres (85 ft) female caught in the Antarctic south of the southern Indian Ocean; the scientist David Edward Gaskin also measured a 25.9 metres (85 ft) female while whaling inspector of the British factory ship <i>Southern Venturer</i> in the Southern Ocean in the 1961-62 season. Terence Wise, who worked as a winch operator aboard the British factory ship <i>Balaena</i>, claimed that "the biggest fin [he] ever saw" was a 25.6 metres (84 ft) specimen caught near <span>Bouvet Island</span> in January 1958. The largest fin whale ever weighed (piecemeal) was a 22.7 metres (74 ft) pregnant female caught by Japanese whalers in the Antarctic in 1948 which weighed 69.5 tonnes (68.4 long tons; 76.6 short tons), minus 6% for loss of fluids during the flensing process. It is estimated that an individual over 27 metres (89 ft) would weigh in excess of 120 tonnes (120 long tons; 130 short tons).</p>

<p>The fin whale is brownish to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally. The left side of the head is dark gray, while the right side exhibits a complex pattern of contrasting light and dark markings. On the right lower jaw is a white or light gray "right mandible patch", which sometimes extends out as a light "blaze" laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw and back to just behind the blowholes. Two narrow dark stripes originate from the eye and ear, the former widening into a large dark area on the shoulder &#x2014; these are separated by a light area called the "interstripe wash". These markings are more prominent on individuals in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific, where they can appear indistinct. The left side exhibits similar but much fainter markings. Dark, oval-shaped areas of pigment called "flipper shadows" extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins. This type of <span>asymmetry</span> is seen in <span>Omura's whale</span> and occasionally in <span>minke whales</span>. It was <span>hypothesized</span> to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it sometimes circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales just as often circle to the left. There is no accepted hypothesis to explain the asymmetry. It has paired <span>blowholes</span> on a prominent splashguard and a broad, flat V-shaped <span>rostrum</span>. A single median ridge stops well short of the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the <span>chevron</span>, begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again. The whale has a series of 56-100 <span>pleats</span> or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the <span>chin</span> to the <span>navel</span> that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding. It has a curved, prominent <span>dorsal fin</span> that ranges in height from 26-75 centimeters (10-30 in) (usually 45-60 centimeters (18-24 in)) and averages about 51 centimetres (20 in), lying about three-quarters of the way along the back. Its <span>flippers</span> are small and tapered and its tail is wide, pointed at the tip and notched in the centre.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-<span>frequency</span> sounds. The vocalizations of blue and fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are <span>frequency-modulated</span> (FM) down-swept <span>infrasonic</span> pulses from 16 to 40 <span>hertz</span> frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two <span>seconds</span>, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have <span>source levels</span> of up to 184-186 <span>decibels</span> relative to 1 <span>micropascal</span> at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected hundreds of miles from their source.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>When fin whale sounds were first recorded by US biologists, they did not realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, <span>geophysical</span> phenomena, or even part of a <span>Soviet Union</span> scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Poor understanding of migration patterns combined with contradictory population surveys makes estimating the historical and current population levels of the whale difficult and contentious. Due to a long <span>history of hunting</span> this whale, pre-exploitation population levels are difficult to determine.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Very little information has been revealed about the ecology of current migration from Antarctic waters are unknown, but small increases in sighting rates are confirmed off <span>New Zealand</span> such as off <span>Kaikoura</span>, and wintering grounds may exist in further north such as in <span>Papua New Guinea</span>, <span>Fiji</span>, and off <span>East Timor</span>. Finbacks are also relatively abundant along the coast of <span>Peru</span> and <span>Chile</span> (in Chile, most notably off <span>Los Lagos</span> region such as <span>Gulf of Corcovado</span> in <span>Chilo&#xE9; National Park</span> and <span>Caleta Zorra</span> (see the <span>Alfaguara project</span>). They are known to make mixed groups with other rorquals such as Blue whales and Sei whales. Their recovery is confirmed vicinity to various <span>Subantarctic Islands</span> such as <span>South Georgia</span> and <span>Falkland</span>, but unknown in other historical habitats including <span>Campbell Island</span>, <span>Kermadec</span> to <span>Chatham Islands</span>, <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> and <span>Gough Island</span></p>

<p>In the North Pacific, they feed on <span>euphausiids</span> in the genera <i><span>Euphausia</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa</span></i>, and <i><span>Nyctiphanes</span></i>, large <span>copepods</span> in the genus <i>Neocalanus</i>, small schooling fish (e.g. the genera <i><span>Engraulis</span></i>, <i><span>Mallotus</span></i>, <i><span>Clupea</span></i>, and <i><span>Theragra</span></i>), and squid. Based on stomach content analysis of over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analyzed the stomach contents of about 7,500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and <span>Bering Sea</span> from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the <span>Aleutian Islands</span> and in the <span>Gulf of Alaska</span> and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off <span>Kamchatka</span>. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58&#xB0; N), their main prey species were <span>capelin</span> (<i>Mallotus villosus</i>), <span>Alaska pollock</span> (<i>Theragra chalcogramma</i>) and <span>Pacific herring</span> (<i>Clupea pallasii</i>); they also consumed <span>saffron cod</span> (<i>Eleginus gracilis</i>). <span>Arctic krill</span> (<i>Thysanoessa raschii</i>) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on <span>herring</span>. They also took large quantities of the copepod <i>Neocalanus cristatus</i> around the Aleutian Islands and in <span>Olyutorsky Bay</span> off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (<i><span>Euphausia pacifica</span></i>, <i>Thysanoessa spinifera</i>, <i>T. inermis</i>, <i>T. raschii</i>, and <i>T. longipes</i>) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the <span>Kuril Islands</span> area, with euphausiids (<i>T. longipes</i>, <i>T. inermis</i>, and <i>T. raschii</i>) and copepods (<i>Neocalanus plumchrus</i> and <i>N. cristatus</i>) being the main prey in the northern area and <span>Japanese flying squid</span> (<i>Todarodes pacificus pacificus</i>) and small schooling fish (e.g. <span>Pacific saury</span>, <i>Cololabis saira</i>; and <span>Japanese anchovy</span>, <i>Engraulis japonicus</i>) dominating the diet in the southern area.</p>

using('balaenoptera physalus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the North Atlantic, they prey on euphausiids in the genera <i><span>Meganyctiphanes</span></i>, <i><span>Thysanoessa</span></i> and <i><span>Nyctiphanes</span></i> and small schooling fish (e.g. the genera <i>Clupea</i>, <i>Mallotus</i>, and <i><span>Ammodytes</span></i>). Of the 1,609 fin whale stomachs examined at the <span>Hvalfj&#xF6;r&#xF0;ur</span> whaling station in southwestern Iceland from 1967 to 1989 (caught between June and September), 96% contained only krill, 2.5% krill and fish, 0.8% some fish remains, 0.7% capelin (<i>M. villosus</i>), and 0.1% sandeel (family Ammodytidae); a small proportion of (mainly juvenile) <span>blue whiting</span> (<i>Micromesistius poutassou</i>) were also found. Of the krill sampled between 1979 and 1989, the vast majority (over 99%) was <span>northern krill</span> (<i>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</i>); only one stomach contained <i>Thysanoessa longicaudata</i>. Off West Greenland, 75% of the fin whales caught between July and October had consumed krill (family Euphausiidae), 17% capelin (<i>Mallotus</i>) and 8% <span>sand lance</span> (<i>Ammodytes sp.</i>). Off eastern <span>Newfoundland</span>, they chiefly feed on capelin, but also take small quantities of euphausiids (mostly <i>T. raschii</i> and <i>T. inermis</i>). In the Ligurian-Corsican-Proven&#xE7;al Basin in the <span>Mediterranean Sea</span> they make dives as deep as 470 metres (1,540 ft) to feed on the euphausiid <i>Meganyctiphanes norvegica</i>, while off the island of <span>Lampedusa</span>, between <span>Tunisia</span> and <span>Sicily</span>, they have been observed in mid-winter feeding on surface swarms of the small euphausiid <i>Nyctiphanes couchi</i>.</p>

<p>In the 19th century, the fin whale was occasionally hunted by open-boat <span>whalers</span>, but it was relatively safe because of its speed and the fact that it often sank when killed. However, the later introduction of steam-powered boats and <span>harpoons</span> that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure them along with blue and <span>sei whales</span> on an industrial scale. As other whale species became over-hunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant fin whale as a substitute. It was primarily hunted for its blubber, <span>oil</span>, and baleen. Approximately 704,000 fin whales were caught in Antarctic whaling operations alone between 1904 and 1975.</p>

Unlike other ibises they have a short neck. Their wing length is 270-290 mm, their bill length is 115-130 mm and their tarsus length is 56-65 mm. Their plumage varies but appears to be most commonly brownish - blue. A small, dark ibis, the best distinguishing feature is suggested by its name; the buff-spotted neck and breast is diagnostic. Otherwise, the upperparts are uniformly dark, with blue skin surrounding the eyes (smaller in females). Flying birds can be distinguished by their broad wings and short tail.

For example, in Gabon birds laid in all months except July and August, with peaks in March-May and September-December. The peaks corresponded to the local rainy seasons. Incubation takes about 20 days. Chicks are independent about forty days after hatch.

<p>The mating call or contact call of the male is a deep, sighing fog-horn or bull-like <i>boom</i> with a quick rise and an only slightly longer fall, easily audible from a distance of three miles on a calm night. "Butter bump" and "bitter bum" were onomatopoeic colloquial names for the bird in some localities. Others, each unique to a particular part of Great Britain, include "bog blutter", "bog-bull", "bog bumper", "bog drum", "boom bird", "bottle-bump", "bull of the bog", "bull of the mire", "bumpy cors", "butter bump" and "heather blutter". The number of names is one indication of how widespread they used to be. The call is mainly given between January and April during the mating season. Surveys of Eurasian bitterns are carried out by noting the number of distinct male booms in a given area. Prior to modern science, it was unknown how such a small bird produced a call so low-pitched: common explanations included that the bird made its call into a straw or that it blew directly into the water. It is now known that the sound is produced by expelling air from the <span>oesophagus</span> with the aid of powerful muscles surrounding it.</p>

using('bubo africanus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Its prey consists of small mammals, birds, insects, frogs, and reptiles. It often swallows quite large prey whole, with much head-jerking, and if the object is really challenging, pausing and resting with the mouth full. Prey too large for such treatment it will tear in the normal raptorial fashion, and it also tears shreds off prey to feed nestlings. The male will hunt and bring food when the female cannot leave the nest. Sometimes, even in conditions verging on starvation, he will tear the head off a mouse, but bring the body for the female to feed to the young, or to eat herself if the eggs have not yet hatched. The species is a non-specialised feeder, in contrast to say, the barn owls (Tyto) and is accordingly itinerant, remaining in a given region to hunt for a few weeks or months, then moving on when the local prey is no longer plentiful or easy to catch. Typically it will return at odd intervals of a year or two, depending on local conditions. An adult pair is typically very aggressive in defence of its hunting territory, and one obstacle for an adolescent to overcome is to find good feeding grounds where there are no incumbent adults to eject or kill it.</p>

This owl is the world's third heaviest living owl, after <span>Blakiston's fish owl</span> and the <span>Eurasian eagle-owl</span> and the fourth longest owl, after additionally the <span>great gray owl</span>.</p>

using('bubo lacteus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Verreaux's eagle-owl is a very large and powerful owl species. It ranges from 60-66 cm (24-26 in) in length. This species has an average wingspan of 140 cm (55 in). The body mass is 1,600-2,000 g (3.5-4.4 lb) in males, with an average of 1,700 g (3.7 lb) against a body mass of 2,500-3,150 g (5.51-6.94 lb), averaging 2,625 g (5.787 lb), in the larger females. Among standard measurements, each <span>wing chord</span> measures 42-49 cm (17-19 in), the tail is 22-27.5 cm (8.7-10.8 in) long and the <span>tarsus</span> is 8 cm (3.1 in).</p>

using('bubo lacteus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Upon hatching, the new young weigh 60-70 g (2.1-2.5 oz) and almost right away have apparent pink eyelids. The first egg to hatch is the first to be fed, and if food is not plentiful only, the second chick often starves to death. If food is abundant, both owlets will be fed and may survive. The female broods the chicks consistently for 20 days. Intruding animals who get too close to the nest are attacked. The chicks are ready to leave the nest at around 63 days of age but only fly well around 2 weeks after this. The fledgings are hidden and rather inactive for around 3 months, only starting to catch their own prey at around 5 months. Some young may remain with their parents for up to 2 years. Sexual maturity is reached at 3 to 4 years of age. There is little data on longevity in wild adults, although captive ones have lived for up to 15 years.</p>

<p>The cattle egret is a stocky <span>heron</span> with an 88-96 cm (35-38 in) wingspan; it is 46-56 cm (18-22 in) long and weighs 270-512 g (9.5-18.1 oz). It has a relatively short thick neck, a sturdy <span>bill</span>, and a hunched posture. The non-breeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff <span>plumes</span> on the back, breast and <span>crown</span>, and the bill, legs and <span>irises</span> become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. The sexes are similar, but the male is marginally larger and has slightly longer breeding plumes than the female; juvenile birds lack coloured plumes and have a black bill.</p>

using('bubulcus ibis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The cattle egret feeds on a wide range of prey, particularly <span>insects</span>, especially <span>grasshoppers</span>, <span>crickets</span>, <span>flies</span> (adults and maggots), and <span>moths</span>, as well as <span>spiders</span>, <span>frogs</span>, and <span>earthworms</span>. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a <span>banyan</span> tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with <span>cattle</span> and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6 times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows <span>farm machinery</span>, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines.</p>

<p>This is a large bird, at 90 to 129 centimetres (35.4 to 50.8 in) long. Females weigh 2.2 to 4.6 kilograms (4.9 to 10.1 lb), while the larger males weigh 3.5 to 6.2 kilograms (7.7 to 13.7 lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord has been measured from 49.5 to 61.8 cm (19.5 to 24.3 in), the tail from 29 to 36 cm (11 to 14 in), the tarsus from 13 to 15.5 cm (5.1 to 6.1 in) and the culmen from 16.8 to 22.1 cm (6.6 to 8.7 in). Per Stevenson and Fanshawe, the Abyssinian ground hornbill is the larger species on average, at 110 cm (43 in), than the Southern species, at 102 cm (40 in), but published weights and standard measurements contrarily indicate the Southern species is indeed slightly larger.</p>

<p>The period of parental dependence following a 40 to 45-day incubation period and an 85-day fledging period is between one and two years depending on climatic conditions before young are independent of parents and helpers, which is the longest of any bird.

<p>At a height of up to 175 cm (5.74 ft), it is the largest crane in <span>Africa</span> and is the second tallest species of crane, after the <span>Sarus Crane</span>. The wingspan is 230-260 cm (7.5-8.5 ft), the length is typically 120 cm (3.9 ft) and weight is 6.4-7.9 kg (14-17 lb) in females, 7.5-9 kg (17-20 lb) in males. Among standard measurements, the wing chord length is 61.3-71.7 cm (24.1-28.2 in), the exposed <span>culmen</span> is 12.4-18.5 cm (4.9-7.3 in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 23.2-34.2 cm (9.1-13.5 in). The back and wings are ashy gray. The feathered portion of the head is dark slate gray above the eyes and on the crown, but is otherwise white, including the wattles, which are almost fully feathered and hang down from under the upper throat. The breast, primaries, secondaries, and tail coverts are black. The secondaries are long and nearly reach the ground. The upper breast and neck are white all the way to the face. The skin in front of the eye extending to the base of the beak and tip of the <span>wattles</span> is red and bare of <span>feathers</span> and covered by small round wart-like bumps. Wattled Cranes have long <span>bills</span> and black legs and toes. Males and females are virtually indistinguishable, although males tend to be slightly larger.</p>

using('bugeranus carunculatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Wattled Cranes commence their breeding season around April. Most nest are sloppily crushed impressions of grass along the border of a marsh. They may use an old spur-winged goose nest or make their own. Eggs are laid approximately 3 weeks after the nests are built. The average clutch size of the species is reportedly the smallest of any of the world's cranes, with an average of 1.6 eggs. Even if there are two eggs, usually only one chick successfully survives to hatch or fledge. The incubation period, roughly 33 to 36 days, is on average the longest of any crane and both parents participate. The chicks are immediately feed by both parents, which take shifts. After around 80 days, the chick(s) start to forage with their parents. At the first sign of any danger, the parents force their young into tall grasses to hide. The fledging period occurs at 100-150 days, the longest it takes any crane to fledge. The young remain with their parents for up to a year (when the next breeding period starts) and may gather in flocks with unrelated juveniles.</p>

Their feeding techniques include the use of shallow probes into the mud while pacing along the shore. When the tide is ebbing, they tend to peck at the surface and in soft mud they may probe and plough forward with the bill inserted to about a centimetre depth. The bivalved mollusc <i><span>Macoma</span></i> is their preferred prey on European coasts, swallowing them whole and breaking them up in their gizzard. In <span>Delaware Bay</span>, they feed in large numbers on the eggs of horseshoe crabs which spawn just as the birds arrive in mid-summer. They are able to detect molluscs buried under wet sand from changes in the pressure of water that they sense using <span>Herbst corpuscles</span> in their bill. Unlike many tactile feeders their <span>visual field</span> is not panoramic (allowing for an almost 360 degree field of view), as during the short breeding season they switch to being visual hunters of mobile, unconcealed prey, which are obtained by pecking. Pecking is also used to obtain some surface foods in the wintering and migratory feeding grounds, such as the eggs of <span>horseshoe crabs</span>.</p>

using('calidris subminuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The long-toed stint is a very small wader measuring just 13 to 16 cm (5.1 to 6.3 in) in length with a wingspan of 26.5 to 30.5 cm (10.4 to 12.0 in). It weighs about 25 g (0.9 oz). It has a small head and short, straight sharp-tipped beak. The neck is slender,the belly rounded and the long legs are set well back. The toes are long and slender, especially the middle one. The primary feathers extend as far as the tail. The crown is brown and there is a pale streak just above the eye. The upper parts are brown with the centres of the feathers darker brown. The breast is speckled with pale brown and the underparts are white.

<p>The Long-toed Stint breeds in Siberia during the Northern Hemisphere summer. Little is known of its breeding habits but its breeding range includes the <span>Chukchi Peninsula</span>, the <span>Koryak Plateau</span>, the <span>Commander Islands</span>, the <span>Kuril Islands</span>, land bordering the <span>Sea of Okhotsk</span>, north <span>Verkhoyansky District</span> and around the <span>Ob River</span> and the <span>Irtysh River</span>. After the breeding season it migrates southwards passing through China, Indochina, Malaysia and the Philippines and westwards to Burma, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands. It is a visitor to New Guinea and Australia and a <span>vagrant</span> to Sweden, South Africa, Melanesia, Hawaii, the northwestern USA and the vicinity of the Bering Sea. In its over-wintering range it visits a variety of wetland habitats including shallow freshwater or brackish areas, lakes, swamps, floodplains, marshes, lagoons, muddy shores and sewage ponds.</p>

<p>The long-toed stint forages in wet habitats, probing the ground with its beak. It feeds on molluscs, crustaceans, amphibians, insects, other invertebrates and seeds. It roosts in hollows in soft mud or in low vegetation bordering its feeding area. In its breeding range in Russia its habitat is tundra, taiga, open grassy bogs or swamps. The nesting site tends to be in an area with mosses, sedges and dwarf willows and is typically a well-hidden, shallow depression on a mound of sedge or dried grass.</p>

using('calidris subminuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The long-toed stint has a very wide range and it is estimated that there are somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals globally. There may be in the region of 25,000 breeding pairs.

<p>The golden jackal is very similar to the grey wolf in general appearance, but is distinguished by its smaller size, lighter weight, shorter legs, more elongated torso and shorter tail. The end of the tail just reaches the heel or slightly below it. The head is lighter than the wolf's, with a less-prominent forehead, and the muzzle is narrower and more pointed.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The golden jackal's courtship rituals are remarkably long, lasting 26-28 days, during which the breeding pair remains almost constantly together. In Transcaucasia, <span>estrus</span> begins in early February, and occasionally late January during warm winters. <span>Spermatogenesis</span> in males occurs 10-12 days before the females enter estrus, which lasts for 3-4 days. Females failing to mate during this time will undergo a loss of receptivity which lasts six to eight days.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, female golden jackals usually give birth in burrows dug with the assistance of males, or they occupy derelict fox or badger dens. The burrow is dug a few days before parturition, with both the male and female taking turns digging. The burrow is located either in thick shrubs, on the slopes of <span>gulleys</span> or on flat surfaces. A golden jackal burrow is a simple structure with a single opening. Its length is about 2 metres, while the nest chamber occurs at a depth of 1.0-1.4 metres. In Dagestan and Azerbaijan, litters are sometimes are located within the hollows of fallen trees, tree roots and under stones on river banks. In Middle Asia, the golden jackal does not dig burrows, but constructs lairs in dense <span>tugai</span> thickets. Jackals in the Vakhsh tugais construct 3-metre-long burrows under tree roots or directly in dense thickets. Jackals in the tugais and cultivated lands of Tajikistan construct lairs in long grass plumes, shrubs and reed openings.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The golden jackal rarely hunts in groups, though packs of 8-12 jackals consisting of more than one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. When hunting singly, the golden jackal will trot around an area, occasionally stopping to sniff and listen. Once prey is located, it will conceal itself, quickly approach, then pounce. When hunting in pairs or packs, jackals run parallel to their prey and overtake it in unison. When hunting aquatic rodents or birds, they will run along both sides of narrow rivers or streams, driving their prey from one jackal to another. The golden jackal rarely catches hares, as they are faster than it. <span>Gazelle</span> mothers (often working in groups of two or three) are formidable when defending their young against single jackals, which are much more successful in hunting gazelle fawns when working in pairs. Jackal pairs will methodically search for concealed gazelle fawns within herds, tall grass, bushes and other likely hiding places.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The golden jackal is a <span>generalist</span> that adapts to local food abundances, a trait which allows it to occupy a variety of different habitats and exploit a large number of food resources. Its lithe body and long legs allows it to trot for large distances in search of food. It has the ability to forego liquids, and has been observed on islands with no fresh water. Although the most desert-adapted jackal, it can survive in temperatures as low as -25&#xB0; or -35&#xB0;, though it is not maximally adapted for living in snowy areas. Its preferred habitats consist of flat <span>shrublands</span>, humid <span>reeded</span> areas and <span>floodplains</span>. Although it generally avoids mountainous forests, it may enter alpine and subalpine areas during dispersal. In Turkey, Caucasus and Transcaucasia, it has been observed at heights of up to 1,000 <span>AMSL</span>, particularly in areas where the climate forces shrublands into high elevations.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The jackal's recent expansion throughout eastern and western Europe has been attributed to historical declines in wolf populations. The present diffusion of the golden jackal in the northern Adriatic hinterland seems to be in rapid expansion in various areas where the wolf is absent or very rare. However, some jackals have been observed to follow and feed alongside wolves without evoking any hostility. In Africa, golden jackals often eat alongside African wild dogs, and will stand their ground if the dogs try to harass them. In South-eastern Asia, golden jackals have been known to hunt alongside <span>dhole</span> packs, and there is one record of a golden jackal pack adopting a male <span>Ethiopian wolf</span>.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Jackals will feed alongside <span>spotted hyenas</span>, though they will be chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating jackal flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating one. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other when no food or young is at stake. Jackals will confront a hyena approaching too closely to their dens by taking turns in biting the hyena's hocks until it retreats. <span>Striped hyenas</span> have been known to prey on golden jackals.</p>

using('canis aureus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The vocabulary of the golden jackal is similar to that of the domestic dog, though more "plaintive", with seven different sounds having been recorded. The golden jackal's vocalisations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles. Different subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls. One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening wail, of which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls (transcribed as "<i>Ai-yai! Ai-yai!</i>"), and a series of short, staccato howls (transcribed as "<i>Dead Hindoo, where, where, where?</i>"). These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status.</p>

<p>In Greece, jackals tend not to be as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes are, though they can become a serious nuisance to small stock when in high numbers. In southern Bulgaria, 1,053 attacks on small stock, mainly sheep and lambs, were recorded between 1982 and 1987, along with some damages to newborn deer in game farms. In Israel, about 1.5%-1.9% of calves born on the <span>Golan Heights</span> die due to predation, mainly by golden jackals. In both cases, the high predation rate is attributable to a jackal population explosion due to the high availability of food in illegal garbage dumps. Preventive measures to avoid predation were also lacking in both cases.</p>

<p>Black-backed jackals are small, fox-like canids and are the smallest of the three species called jackal. They measure 30-48 cm (12-19 in) in shoulder height and 60-90 cm (24-35 in) in length. The tail measures 26-40 cm (10-16 in) in length. Weight varies according to location; East African jackals weigh 7-13.8 kg (15-30 lb).

<p>The general colour is reddish-brown to tan, while the flanks and legs are redder. Males tend to be more brightly coloured than females, particularly in their winter coat. The back is intermixed with silver and black hairs, while the underparts are white. Their tails have a black tip, unlike side-striped jackals, which have white-tipped tails. The back of the ears are light yellowish-brown, well covered with hair without and within. The hair of the face measures 10-15 mm in length, and lengthens to 30-40 mm on the rump. The <span>guard hairs</span> of the back are 60 mm on the shoulder, decreasing to 40 mm at the base of the tail. The hairs of the tail are the longest, measuring 70 mm in length.</p>

<p>Black-backed jackals are omnivores, which feed on <span>invertebrates</span>, such as <span>beetles</span>, <span>grasshoppers</span>, <span>crickets</span>, <span>termites</span>, <span>millipedes</span>, <span>spiders</span> and <span>scorpions</span>. They will also feed on mammals, such as <span>rodents</span>, <span>hares</span> and young <span>antelopes</span> up to the size of <span>topi</span> calves. They will also feed on carrion, <span>lizards</span>, and <span>snakes</span>. A pair of black-backed jackals in the Kalahari desert was observed to kill and devour a <span>kori bustard</span> and, on a separate occasion, a <span>black mamba</span> via prolonged harassment of the snake and crushing of the snake's head. Black-backed jackals will occasionally feed on fruits and berries. In coastal areas, they will feed on beached <span>marine mammals</span>, <span>seals</span>, <span>fish</span> and <span>mussels</span>. A single jackal is capable of killing a healthy adult <span>impala</span> (individual infirm). Adult <span>dik dik</span> and <span>Thomson's gazelles</span> seem to be the upper limit of their killing capacity, though they will target larger species if they are sick, with one pair having been observed to harass a crippled bull <span>rhinoceros</span>. They typically kill tall prey by biting at the legs and loins, and will frequently go for the throat. In Serengeti woodlands, they feed heavily on <span>African Grass Rats</span>. In East Africa, during the <span>dry season</span>, they hunt the young of <span>gazelles</span>, impalas, topi, <span>tsessebe</span> and <span>warthogs</span>. In South Africa, black-backed jackals frequently prey on antelopes (primarily impala and <span>springbok</span> and occasionally <span>duiker</span>, <span>reedbuck</span> and <span>steenbok</span>), carrion, hares, hoofed livestock, insects, and rodents. They will also prey on small carnivores, such as <span>mongooses</span>, <span>polecats</span> and <span>wild cats</span>.

Sheep losses to black-backed jackals in a 440 km study area in <span>KwaZulu-Natal</span> consisted of 0.05% of the sheep population. Of 395 sheep killed in a sheepfarming area in KwaZulu-Natal, 13% were killed by jackals. Jackals usually kill sheep via a throat bite, and will begin feeding by opening the flank and consuming the flesh and skin of the flank, heart, liver, some ribs, haunch of hind leg, and sometimes the stomach and its contents. In older lambs, the main portions eaten are usually heart and liver. Usually only one lamb per night is killed in any one place, but sometimes two and occasionally three may be killed. In sheep farming areas, black-backed jackals will time their pup births to coincide with the lambing season. The oral history of the <span>Khoikhoi</span> indicates they have been a nuisance to pastoralists long before European settlement. South Africa has been using fencing systems to protect sheep from jackals since the 1890s, though such measures have mixed success, as the best fencing is expensive, and jackals can easily infiltrate cheap wire fences.</p>

<p>The pygmy right whale is rarely encountered and consequently little studied. However, it is known that it is by far the smallest of the baleen whales. Calves are estimated to be about 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in) to 2.2 metres (7 ft 3 in) at birth (a 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) fetus was reported from a 6 metres (20 ft) female). By the time they are weaned they may be about 3 metres (9.8 ft) to 3.5 metres (11 ft) long. It is believed they become sexually mature at about 5 metres (16 ft) and physically mature at about 6 metres (20 ft). The longest male was a 6.1 metres (20 ft) individual which had stranded in <span>Cloudy Bay, Tasmania</span>, while the longest female was a 6.45 metres (21.2 ft) individual which had stranded in <span>Stanley, Tasmania</span>. Pygmy rights can weigh as much as 3,430 kg&#x2014;a 6.21 metres (20.4 ft) female weighed 3,200 kg and a 5.47 metres (17.9 ft) male weighed 2,850 kg. Gestation and lactation periods and longevity are all unknown. Part of the reason for the scarcity of data may be the relative inactivity of the whale, making location for study difficult. The blow is small and indistinct and the whale is usually a slow undulating swimmer, although capable of bursts of acceleration.</p>

<p>The coloring and shape of the pygmy right whale, dark gray dorsally and lighter gray ventrally, commonly with a pair of chevron-shaped lighter patches behind the eyes, is similar to that of the <span>dwarf minke</span> and <span>Antarctic minke whales</span> and at sea may easily be confused with these two species if the jaw and flippers are not carefully observed. The arched jawline is not as pronounced as other <span>right whales</span> and may not be sufficient to distinguish a pygmy right whale from a minke whale. The long, narrow cream-coloured baleen plates with a distinctive white gumline are the most effective discriminators. Unlike true right whales, pygmy rights do not have <span>callosities</span>. The <span>dorsal fin</span> is falcate (crescent-shaped) and located about three-quarters of the way along the back of the animal. Unlike the minke whales, occasionally the dorsal will not be seen on the whale surfacing. Like the minkes, though, it doesn't raise its flukes when it dives.</p>

<p>The skull and skeleton of the pygmy right whale is unlike those of any other extant whale: the <span>supraoccipital shield</span> extends farther posteriorly; the <span>ear bone</span> has a lateral wrinkle and is roughly square in outline. All seven cervical vertebrae are fused, and the pygmy right has only 44 vertebrae. The 18 pairs of ribs are broad and flat, and make up 39-45% of the vertebral column (compared to 33% in other mysticetes.) Each thoracic vertebrae has a pair of huge wing-like transverse processes, many of which overlap. The dorsal end of the ribs are remarkably thin and almost fail to make contact with the transverse processes. The reduced tail (or sacrocaudal region) features a vestigial pelvis and small chevron bones. The flippers have four digits. The lungs and heart are relatively small which suggests that the pygmy right is not a deep diver. The larynx is reported to be different from any other cetacean. Like other mysticetes, the pygmy right has a large <span>laryngeal sac</span>, but in contrast to other mysticetes, this sac is positioned on the right side of the midline in the pygmy right. The presence of this laryngeal sac can possibly be the explanation for the long thorax and flattened ribs, but the peculiar ribs have been the source many speculations.</p>

<p>The <b>European nightjar</b>, <b>Eurasian nightjar</b> or just <b>nightjar</b> (<i>Caprimulgus europaeus</i>) is a <span>crepuscular</span> and <span>nocturnal</span> bird in the <span>nightjar</span> <span>family</span> that breeds across most of Europe and temperate Asia. The Latin <span>generic name</span> refers to the old myth that the nocturnal nightjar suckled goats, causing them to cease to give milk. The six <span>subspecies</span> differ <span>clinally</span>, the birds becoming smaller and paler towards the east of the range. All populations are <span>migratory</span>, wintering in <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. Their densely patterned grey and brown plumage makes individuals difficult to see in the daytime when they rest on the ground or perch motionless along a branch, although the male shows white patches in the wings and tail as he flies at night.</p>

<p>The <span>nightjars</span>, Caprimulgidae, are a large <span>family</span> of mostly <span>nocturnal</span> <span>insect-eating</span> birds. The largest and most widespread <span>genus</span> is <i><span>Caprimulgus</span></i>, characterised by stiff bristles around the mouth, long pointed wings, a comb-like middle claw and patterned plumage. The males, and sometimes females, often have white markings in the wing or tail. Within the genus, the European nightjar's closest relatives are two African species with similar songs, the <span>rufous-cheeked nightjar</span> and the <span>sombre nightjar</span>. It is replaced further east in Asia by the <span>jungle nightjar</span> which occupies similar habitat.</p>

using('caprimulgus europaeus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The European nightjar is 24.5-28 cm (9.6-11.0 in) long, with a 52-59 cm (20-23 in) wingspan. The male weighs 51-101 g (1.8-3.6 oz) and the female 67-95 g (2.4-3.4 oz). The adult of the nominate subspecies has greyish-brown upperparts with dark streaking, a pale buff hindneck collar and a white moustachial line. The closed wing is grey with buff spotting, and the underparts are greyish-brown, with brown barring and buff spots. The bill is blackish, the <span>iris</span> is dark brown and the legs and feet are brown.</p>

using('caprimulgus europaeus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due to their soft plumage, and very buoyant. Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three <span>primary feathers</span> and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults <span>moult</span> their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and <span>flight feathers</span> on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, in which case the entire moult may take place in Africa.</p>

<p>Other nightjar species occur in parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The <span>red-necked nightjar</span> breeds in <span>Iberia</span> and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar, and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the wing <span>coverts</span>. The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation "is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge".</p>

<p>All populations are <span>migratory</span>, and most birds winter in Africa south of the <span>Sahara</span>, with just a few records from Pakistan, Morocco and Israel. Migration is mainly at night, singly or in loose groups of up to twenty birds. European breeders cross the Mediterranean and North Africa, whereas eastern populations move through the <span>Middle East</span> and East Africa. Some Asian birds may therefore cross 100&#xB0; of <span>longitude</span> on their travels. Most birds winter in eastern or southeastern Africa, although individuals of the nominate race have been recently discovered wintering in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; records elsewhere in West Africa may be wintering birds of this subspecies or <i>C. e. meridionalis</i>. Most autumn migration takes place from August to September, and the birds return to the breeding grounds by May. Vagrants have occurred in Iceland, the <span>Faroe Islands</span>, the Seychelles, the <span>Azores</span>, <span>Madeira</span> and the <span>Canary Islands</span>.</p>

<p>The European nightjar is <span>crepuscular</span> and <span>nocturnal</span>. During the day it rests on the ground, often in a partly shaded location, or perches motionless lengthwise along an open branch or a similar low perch. The <span>cryptic</span> plumage makes it difficult to see in the daytime, and birds on the ground, if they are not already in shade, will turn occasionally to face the sun thereby minimising their shadow. If it feels threatened, the nightjar flattens itself to the ground with eyes almost closed, flying only when the intruder is 2-5 m (7-16 ft) away. It may call or wing clap as it goes, and land as far as 40 m (130 ft) from where it was flushed. In the wintering area it often roosts on the ground but also uses tree branches up to 20 m (66 ft) high. Roost sites at both the breeding and wintering grounds are used regularly if they are undisturbed, sometimes for weeks at a time.</p>

using('caprimulgus europaeus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Eggs are laid 36-48 hours apart, and incubation, mainly by the female, starts with the first egg. The male may incubate for short periods, especially around dawn or dusk, but spends the day roosting, sometimes outside his territory or close to other males. If the female is disturbed while breeding, she runs or flutters along the ground feigning injury until she has drawn the intruder away. She may also move the eggs a short distance with her bill. Each egg hatches after about 17-21 days. The <span>semi-precocial</span> downy chicks are mobile when hatched, but are brooded to keep them warm. They <span>fledge</span> in 16-17 days and become independent of the adults around 32 days after hatching. A second brood may be raised by early nesting pairs, in which case the female leaves the first brood a few days before they fledge; the male then cares for the first brood and assists with the second. Both adults feed the young with balls of insects which are either regurgitated into the chick's mouth or pecked by the chick from the adult's open bill.</p>

<p>European nightjars hunt by sight, silhouetting their prey against the night sky. They tend to flycatch from a perch on moonlit nights, but fly continuously on darker nights when prey is harder to see. Hunting frequency reduces in the middle of the night. Although they have very small bills, the mouth can be opened very wide as they catch insects. They have long sensitive bristles around the mouth, which may help to locate or funnel prey into the mouth. Indigestible parts of insects, such as the <span>chitin</span> <span>exoskeleton</span>, are regurgitated as <span>pellets</span>.</p>

<p>The caracal is distinguished from <i>Felis</i> by the presence of a long tuft on the tip of the <span>ears</span>, exceeding half their length. No trace of pattern remains in the coat, except a few spots on the underside and inside of the fore legs. It is a slender, long-legged cat of medium size with a relatively short <span>tail</span>. The <span>fur</span> on the back and sides is generally of a uniform tawny grey or reddish, frosted-sand colour. The belly and the undersides of the legs and chest are whitish and spotted or blotched with pale markings. The tufted ears are black-backed. <span>Black</span> caracals also occur. The <span>skull</span> is high and rounded. The jaw is short, stoutly built, and equipped with large, powerful teeth. About 92% of caracals lack the second upper <span>premolar</span> teeth. Males reach a head and body length of 75 to 105.7 cm (29.5 to 41.6 in), with a 23.1- to 34-cm-long tail, and weigh 8.0 to 20 kg (17.6 to 44.1 lb). Females are smaller with a head and body length of 69 to 102.9 cm (27.2 to 40.5 in) and a tail 19.5 to 34 cm (7.7 to 13.4 in) long. They weigh from 7.0 to 15.9 kg (15.4 to 35.1 lb).</p>

<p>Their home ranges are large in arid areas. Three males averaged 316.4 km (122.2 sq mi) on Namibian ranchland. In northern <span>Saudi Arabia</span>, a <span>radio-tracked</span> male ranged over 270 to 1,116 km (104 to 431 sq mi) in different seasons. In an agricultural area in <span>Israel</span>'s <span>Negev Desert</span>, male home ranges averaged 220.6 km (85.2 sq mi). Home range size was positively correlated with body weight, and negatively correlated with prey availability. Male home ranges overlapped substantially (50%), and typically included those of several females. Two dispersals were observed: a male migrated 60 to 90 km (37 to 56 mi) south before establishing a home range, whereas a female remained in the vicinity of her natal range, with her range partly overlapping that of her mother. Twenty caracals, several of them transients, were found to use an area of 100 km (39 sq mi) with some ranging outside this area, making for a relatively high local density despite the large home ranges. Male home ranges in better-watered environments of South Africa are smaller. In the <span>West Coast National Park</span>, South Africa, home ranges of two males averaged 26.9 km (10.4 sq mi), and those of three females 7.39 km (2.85 sq mi). Male home ranges overlapped completely with those of females, whereas female ranges overlapped between zero and 19%.

<p>Caracals can survive without drinking for a long period&#x2014;their water demand is satisfied with the body fluids of prey. They are known for their ability to capture <span>birds</span> by leaping 2 m (6.6 ft) or more into the air from a standing start. They hunt by stalking their prey, approaching within about 5 m (16 ft) before suddenly sprinting. They kill smaller prey with a bite to the nape of the neck, and larger animals by biting the throat and then raking with their claws. They sometimes cover larger prey if they cannot consume the whole carcass in a single meal, and return to it later. Some have even been observed to hide carcasses in trees. They live mainly on prey smaller than 5 kg (11 lb), including <span>hyraxes</span>, <span>springhares</span>, <span>gerbils</span>, <span>mice</span>, and birds. They are capable of taking <span>antelopes</span>, including species such as <span>mountain reedbuck</span>, <span>springbok</span>, <span>common duiker</span>, and <span>steenbok</span>.

The secretive behavior of Abbott&#x2019;s duiker, along with its largely nocturnal habits and preference for dense vegetation, means little is known about the ecology and behavior of this species. It has been observed feeding on leaves in the forest understory, and on vegetation in forest clearings, and may feed on fruits, flowers and moss.

Remains of this white rhino have been found at <span>Langebaanweg</span> near <span>Cape Town</span>.

It has been suggested that the modern white rhino has a longer skull than <i>Ceratotherium praecox</i> to facilitate consumption of shorter grasses which resulted from the long term trend to drier conditions in Africa.

<p>The <b>white stork</b> (<i>Ciconia ciconia</i>) is a large <span>bird</span> in the <span>stork</span> family Ciconiidae. Its <span>plumage</span> is mainly white, with black on its wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100-115 cm (39-45 in) from beak tip to end of tail, with a 155-215 cm (61-85 in) wingspan. The two <span>subspecies</span>, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to <span>Finland</span>), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern <span>Kazakhstan</span>) and southern Africa. The white stork is a long-distance <span>migrant</span>, wintering in Africa from tropical <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span> to as far south as <span>South Africa</span>, or on the <span>Indian subcontinent</span>. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the <span>Mediterranean Sea</span> and detours via the <span>Levant</span> in the east or the <span>Strait of Gibraltar</span> in the west, because the air <span>thermals</span> on which it depends do not form over water.</p>

<p>The white stork is a large bird. It has a length of 100-115 cm (39-45 in), and a standing height of 100-125 cm (39-49 in). The wingspan is 155-215 cm (61-85 in) and its weight is 2.3-4.5 kg (5.1-9.9 lb). Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck and a long straight pointed <span>beak</span>. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. The <span>plumage</span> is mainly white with black <span>flight feathers</span> and wing <span>coverts</span>; the black is caused by the pigment <span>melanin</span>. The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The <span>irises</span> are dull brown or grey, and the peri-<span>orbital</span> skin is black. The adult has a bright red beak and red legs, the colouration of which is derived from <span>carotenoids</span> in the diet. In parts of Spain, studies have shown that the pigment is based on <span>astaxanthin</span> obtained from an introduced species of crayfish (<i><span>Procambarus clarkii</span></i>) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings, in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere.</p>

<p>As with other storks, the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar. In flapping <span>flight</span> its wingbeats are slow and regular. It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail. It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched. In contrast, it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting. <span>Moulting</span> has not been extensively studied, but appears to take place throughout the year, with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season.</p>

<p>Within its range the white stork is distinctive when seen on the ground but, when seen at a distance in flight, it can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns, such as the <span>yellow-billed stork</span>, <span>great white pelican</span> and <span>Egyptian vulture</span>. The yellow-billed stork is identified by its black tail and a longer, slightly curved, yellow beak. The white stork also tends to be larger than the yellow-billed stork. The great white pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail, and it flies with its neck retracted, keeping its head near to its stocky body, giving it a different flight profile. Pelicans also behave differently, soaring in orderly, synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the white stork does. The Egyptian vulture is much smaller, with a long wedge-shaped tail, shorter legs and a small yellow-tinged head on a short neck. The <span>common crane</span>, which can also look black and white in strong light, shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight.</p>

<p>A decline in population began in the 19th century due to <span>industrialisation</span> and changes in agricultural methods. White storks no longer nest in many countries, and the current strongholds of the western population are in Portugal, Spain, Ukraine and Poland. In the Iberian Peninsula, populations are concentrated in the southwest, and have also declined due to agricultural practices. A study published in 2005 found that the <span>Podhale</span> region in the uplands of southern Poland had seen an influx of white storks, which first bred there in 1931 and have nested at progressively higher altitudes since, reaching 890 m (3000 ft) in 1999. The authors proposed that this was related to <span>climate warming</span>, and the influx of other animals and plants to higher altitudes. White storks arriving in Pozna&#x144; province (<span>Greater Poland Voivodeship</span>) in western Poland in spring to breed did so some 10 days earlier in the last twenty years of the 20th century than at the end of the 19th century.</p>

<p>To avoid a long sea crossing over the Mediterranean, birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the <span>Bosphorus</span> to Turkey, traversing the <span>Levant</span>, then bypassing the <span>Sahara Desert</span> by following the <span>Nile</span> valley southwards, or follow a western route over the <span>Strait of Gibraltar</span>. These migration corridors maximise help from the thermals and thus save energy. The eastern route is by far the more important with 530,000 white storks using it annually, making the species the second commonest migrant there (after the <span>European honey buzzard</span>). The flocks of migrating <span>raptors</span>, white storks and <span>great white pelicans</span> can stretch for 200 km (125 mi). The eastern route is twice as long as the western, but storks take the same time to reach the wintering grounds by either.</p>

<p>White storks rely on the uplift of air <span>thermals</span> to soar and glide the long distances of their annual migrations between Europe and <span>Sub-Saharan Africa</span>. For many, the shortest route would take them over the <span>Mediterranean Sea</span>; however, since air thermals do not form over water, they generally detour over land to avoid the trans-Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping. It has been estimated that flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled. Thus, flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at the top, up to 1,200-1,500 m (3,900-4,900 ft) above the ground (though one record from Western Sudan observed an altitude of 3,300 m (10,800 ft)).</p>

<p>The adult white stork's main sound is noisy bill-clattering, which has been likened to distant machine gun fire. The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes. The clattering is amplified by its <span>throat pouch</span>, which acts as a <span>resonator</span>. Used in a variety of social interactions, bill-clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts, and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situation&#x2014;for example, slower during copulation and briefer when given as an <span>alarm call</span>. The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss; however, young birds can generate a harsh hiss, various cheeping sounds, and a cat-like mew they use to beg for food. Like the adults, young also clatter their beaks. The <i>up-down display</i> is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, post coitus, and also as a <span>threat display</span>. Breeding pairs are <span>territorial</span> over the summer, and use this display, as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, the population had fallen to fewer than nine pairs in the entire upper <span>Rhine River</span> valley, an area closely identified with the white stork for centuries.

The reintroduction of <span>zoo</span>-reared birds has halted further declines in Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. There were 601 pairs breeding in Armenia and around 700 pairs in the Netherlands in 2008, and few pairs also breed in South Africa, typically recent colonists from within the normal wintering population. In Poland, electric poles have been modified with a platform at the top to prevent the white stork's large nest from disrupting the electricity supply, and sometimes nests are moved from an electric pole to a man-made platform. Introductions of zoo-reared birds in the Netherlands has been followed up by feeding and nest-building programs by volunteers. Similar reintroduction programs are taking place in Sweden, and Switzerland, where 175 pairs were recorded breeding in 2000. Long term viability of the population in Switzerland is unclear as breeding success rates are low, and supplementary feeding does not appear to be of benefit.</p>

Usually the Montagu's Harrier appears more slender in flight than the hen harrier with a longer tail, longer and narrower wings and more pointed "hands". Also its flight is more elegant than the Hen Harrier, with more elastic, almost tern-like wingbeats. The distinction between female Pallid and Montagu's Harriers is the most delicate and can only be made in good conditions as the proportions are similar. The best recognition character is the pale collar around the neck of female and juvenile Pallid Harriers which is not present in the Montagu's.</p>

<p>Prey is caught while flying along fixed routes at low heights and constant low speeds (c. 30 km/h (19 mph)), as is typical of harriers. The flight is considered lighter and more dexterous than other harriers enabling it to take more agile prey. When possible it often follows the edges of various vegetation to catch its prey by surprise. This is taken after a short stoop, though fast running animals and flying birds can be chased over a short distance.</p>

<p>The adult is 44 to 49 cm long, with females being about 30% heavier than males (Simmons and Simmons 2000). Adults, (like the male bird right) have yellow eyes, but brown eyes when immature. Both sexes are mostly brown with pale streaking on the head, breast and forewing and rufous on the thighs and belly. Adult males differ from females in that they have a pale grey wash to the dorsal secondaries and primaries. The female's are brown. The juvenile is dark brown and may have a pale breastband and pale markings on the head. The tail and <span>flight feathers</span> have dark barring at all ages, but this is rarely visible in the juvenile birds.

While females are sometimes credited as slightly larger, there are no great discernible <span>differences</span> in measurements between sexes. Weight can range from 7 to 20 kg (15 to 44 lb), with an average mass of about 12.5 kg (28 lb). Head-and-body length is 67 to 84 cm (26 to 33 in), while the tail is 34 to 47 cm (13 to 19 in) and shoulder height averages 40 cm (16 in). <i>Civettictis civetta</i> is a stocky animal with a long body and appears short-legged for its size although its hind limbs are noticeably larger and more powerful. It has a short broad neck, a pointed muzzle, small rounded ears, small eyes and a long bushy tail.</p>

using('civettictis civetta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The African civet has five digits per <span>manus</span> in which the first toe is slightly set back from the others. The African civet has long, curved, semi-retractile claws. Its feet are compact and unsuitable for digging or climbing and the soles of the feet are hairless. African Civets have a modified <span>synapsid</span> skull which is heavy-built and is the longest of any <span>viverrid</span>. The <span>zygomatic arch</span> is robust and provides a large area for attachment of the <span>masseter muscle</span>. The skull also has a well-developed <span>sagittal crest</span> which provides a large area for attachment of the <span>temporalis muscle</span>. This musculature and the African civet&#x2019;s strong <span>mandible</span> give it a powerful bite oriented to its <span>omnivorous</span> diet.

<p>Like all <span>black-and-white colobi</span>, the Angola colobus has black fur and a black face, surrounded by long, white locks of hair. It also has a mantle of white hair on the shoulders. The long, thin tail can be either black or white, but the tip is always white. There is a significant regional variation in the total amount of white on the body and the length of the fur. Animals that live in the mountains have longer, thicker fur than animals from the lowlands to protect them against the cold.</p>

<p>The <b>mantled guereza</b> (<i>Colobus guereza</i>), also known simply as the <b>guereza</b>, the <b>eastern black-and-white colobus</b>, or the <b>Abyssinian black-and-white colobus</b>, is a <span>black-and-white colobus</span>, a type of <span>Old World monkey</span>. It is native to much of west central and east <span>Africa</span>, including <span>Cameroon</span>, <span>Equatorial Guinea</span>, <span>Nigeria</span>, <span>Ethiopia</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Tanzania</span>, <span>Uganda</span> and <span>Chad</span>. The species consists of several subspecies that differ in appearance. It has a distinctive appearance which is alluded to in its name; the long white fringes of hair the run along each side of its black <span>trunk</span> are known as a mantle. Its face is framed with white hair and it has a large white tail tuft.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The mantled guereza lives in social groups of three to fifteen individuals. These groups normally include a dominant male, several females, and the offspring of the females. It has a <span>polygynous</span> mating system and <span>copulation</span> is initiated with vocal communication. After a <span>gestation period</span> of just over five months, infants are born with pink skin and white fur which darkens to the adult coloration by three to four months. The mantled guereza is well known for its dawn chorus, the males' "roar" is a method of long distance communication which reinforces territorial boundaries. It also makes other vocalization and uses body postures, movements, and facial expressions to communicate.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The mantled guereza has many alternative common names including the guereza, the eastern black-and-white colobus, the magistrate colobus, or the Abyssinian black-and-white colobus. The name "mantled" refers to its mantle, the long silky white fringes of hair that run along its body and "guereza" is the native name of the monkey in Ethiopia. The scientific name <i>Colobus</i> derives from Greek <i>kolobus</i> meaning "mutilated" which refers to its lack of thumbs.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The mantled guereza has a distinctive <span>pelage</span>, it is mostly black, with long white fringes of silky hair&#x2014;known as a mantle or ornamentation&#x2014;along the sides of its body and tail. The bands that make up the mantle start at the shoulders and extend along the back until they connect at the lower torso. The tail is long and ends in a white tuft which varies in how much it covers the tail. These features vary in color among subspecies, for example the tail of <i>C. g. guereza</i> is gray until the white tail tuft which covers half of its length, while the tail tuft of <i>C. g. caudatus</i> makes up 80% of the tail. The mantle color ranges from white to cream or yellow. Its face is framed by white hair and it has bushy cheek hairs. The thigh has a white stripe. Infants are born with pink skin and white hair. The hair and skin darken as they age and by three to four months they attain adult coloration. Male usually gain their coloration before females. The male typically weighs 9.3 and 13.5 kilograms (21 and 30 lb) and the female weighs between 7.8 and 9.2 kilograms (17 and 20 lb). The head and body length averages 61.5 centimetres (24.2 in) for males and 57.6 centimetres (22.7 in) for females. Like most colobi, the mantled guereza has a small thumb that is <span>vestigial</span>. There is dentition <span>sexual dimorphism</span> among the subspecies. In some, the males have larger teeth than females, in others the reverse is true, and some have no significant difference.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The mantled guereza is primarily <span>arboreal</span>, but does sometimes descend on the ground to forage and travel, perhaps more so than most other colobines. It is <span>diurnal</span> and rests for up to half the day. Foraging or travelling are the next most common activity. Sometime after dawn, mantled guereza groups leave their sleeping trees and will return to them at dusk. During the day, the mantled guereza has long rest periods in between periods of moving and feeding. Other activities, including grooming, greeting, playing and being vigilant, are performed to a lesser extent.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Despite its reputation as an exclusive leaf-eater, the mantled guereza is not an obligate <span>folivore</span>. While it mainly eats leaves and fruit, its diet is quite variable. It may eat bark, wood, seeds, flowers, petioles, lianas, aquatic-plants, arthropods, soil, and even concrete from buildings. The amount of each food item in its diet varies by area and time of year. Nutritional factors like protein, tannins, and sodium levels in leaves influence its food choices. It may even intermittently travel longer distances to access plants with higher levels of nutrition. Leaves usually make up over half of its diet, although fruits are occasionally eaten more depending on the season. When foraging for leaves, the mantled guereza prefers young ones over old. With fleshy fruits, the mantled guereza prefers to eat them unripe, which may serve to reduce competition with primates that eat ripe fruits. It consumes a number of plant species but only some make up most of its diet at a specific site. Like all colobi, the mantled guereza is able to digest leaves and other plant fibers with a large, multi-chambered stomach that contains bacteria in certain areas. Like most colobines, it prefers foods with high fiber content that can be easily extracted with its specialized stomach. The mantled guereza is mostly preyed on by the <span>crowned hawk-eagle</span>, but it is also eaten by other <span>birds of prey</span> such as <span>Verreaux's eagle</span>. The <span>common chimpanzee</span> is known to hunt the guereza. The <span>leopard</span> is another possible predator.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The mantled guereza has a <span>polygynous</span> <span>harem</span>-based mating system. Mating solicitations are made by both males and females, half of the time for each. To solicit mating, the mantled guereza will walk near its potential partner and make low-intensity mouth clicks or tough-smacks. During copulation, the males hold on the female's ankles and body. Most matings take place between individuals of the same group but copulations outside of the group have been recorded. In multi-male groups, more than one male may mate with the females. The gestation period lasts 158 days with a 16-22 month interbirth interval. The newborn guereza relies on its mother for support and must cling to her. As they grow older, infants can move on their own but keep returning to their mothers. The infants take up most of the attention in the groups. The other females in a group may handle an infant although the latter are only comfortable with their mothers. The males normally don't pay much attention to infants until they are four to five weeks old. Infants can eat solid food at about eight to nine weeks and by fifty weeks they are fully weaned and no longer need to hold on to their mothers.</p>

using('colobus guereza')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The most notable vocalization of the mantled guereza is the "roar", which is made mainly at night or dawn by males. The sound of a roar can be carried for up to a mile. It is normally the dominant male who roars when there are multiple males in the group. Roars are used for long distance communication and can regulate inter-group spacing without direct, physical contact while foraging. When one male starts roaring, neighboring males will start to roar as well. Often, the mantled guereza will respond to calls regardless of "caller identity," focusing more on the collective vocal displays and not the familiarity of the caller. There is variation in the roars of males which could signal the status of their group and fighting ability. With a roar, a male can advertise his body size; both actual and exaggerated. Other vocalizations are made as well. Males may snort, possibly as an alarm call. "Purrs" are made before group movements. Females and infants may "caw" when under mild distress. When in more serious distress, like if an infant is in danger, females and sub-adults will squeak or scream. "Tongue-clicking" is made during mild aggression. In addition to vocalizations, the mantled guereza communicates with several different body postures and movements, displaying of fringe fur, facial expressions, and touches.</p>

<p>Pigeons, especially <span>homing</span> or <span>carrier</span> breeds, are well known for their ability to find their way home from long distances. Despite these demonstrated abilities, wild rock doves are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas.</p>

<p>The rock dove has a restricted natural resident range in western and southern <span>Europe</span>, <span>North Africa</span>, and into <span>South Asia</span>. The rock dove is often found in pairs in the breeding season but is usually gregarious. The species (including ferals) has a large range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km (3,900,000 sq mi). It has a large global population, including an estimated 17-28 million individuals in Europe. <span>Fossil</span> evidence suggests the rock dove originated in southern Asia and skeletal remains unearthed in <span>Israel</span> confirm their existence there for at least three hundred thousand years. However, this species has such a long history with humans that it is impossible to tell exactly where the species' original range was. Its habitat is natural cliffs, usually on coasts. Its domesticated form, the <span>feral</span> pigeon, has been widely introduced elsewhere, and is common, especially in cities, over much of the world. A rock pigeon's lifespan is anywhere from 3-5 years in the wild to 15 years in captivity, though longer-lived specimens have been reported. The main causes of mortality in the wild are predators and persecution by humans. The species was first introduced to <span>North America</span> in 1606 at <span>Port Royal</span>, <span>Nova Scotia</span>.</p>

<p>The <b>black wildebeest</b> or <b>white-tailed gnu</b> (<i>Connochaetes gnou</i>) is one of the two closely related <span>wildebeest</span> species. It is a member of the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Connochaetes</span></i> and <span>family</span> <span>Bovidae</span>. It was first <span>described</span> in 1780 by <span>Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann</span>. The black wildebeest is typically between 170-220 cm (67-87 in) in head-and-body length, and the average weight is 110-180 kg (240-400 lb). Males stand up to approximately 111-121 cm (44-48 in) at the shoulder, while the height of the females is 106-116 cm (42-46 in). The black wildebeest is characterised by its white, long, horse-like tail. It also has a dark brown to black coat and long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly.</p>

using('connochaetes gnou')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Black wildebeest are <span>sexually dimorphic</span>, with females being smaller in size and more slender than males. The head-and-body length is typically between 170 and 220 cm (67 and 87 in). Males reach approximately 111 to 121 cm (44 to 48 in) at the shoulder, while females reach 106 to 116 cm (42 to 46 in). Males typically weigh 140 to 157 kg (309 to 346 lb) and females 110 to 122 kg (243 to 269 lb). A distinguishing feature in both sexes is the tail, which is long and similar to that of a horse. Its bright-white colour gives this animal the vernacular name of "white-tailed gnu", and also distinguishes it from the blue wildebeest, which has a black tail. The length of the tail ranges from 80 to 100 cm (31 to 39 in).</p>

using('connochaetes gnou')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The black wildebeest has a dark brown or black <span>coat</span> which is slightly paler in summer and coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped <span>manes</span> that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up from the back of the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.</p>

using('connochaetes gnou')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Both sexes have strong <span>horns</span> that curve forward, resembling hooks and are up to 78 cm (31 in) long. The horns have a broad base in mature males, and are flattened to form a protective shield. In females, the horns are both shorter and narrower. They become fully developed in females in the third year, while it is not before the age of four or five that horns are fully grown in males. The black wildebeest normally has 13 <span>thoracic vertebrae</span>, though specimens with 14 have been reported, and this species shows a tendency for the thoracic region to become elongated. There are <span>scent glands</span> that secrete a glutinous substance in front of the eyes, under the hair tufts and on the forefeet. Females have two <span>nipples</span>. Apart from the difference in the appearance of the tail, the two species of wildebeest also differ in size and colour, with the black being smaller and darker than the blue.</p>

using('connochaetes gnou')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Where it lives alongside the blue wildebeest, the two species can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the maintenance of the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds but by the end of the nineteenth century, it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued.</p>

using('connochaetes taurinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The blue wildebeest is a <span>herbivore</span>, feeding primarily on the short grasses. It forms herds which move about in loose aggregations, the animals being fast runners and extremely wary. The mating season begins at the end of the rainy season and a single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with its mother for eight months, after which time it joins a juvenile herd. Blue wildebeest are found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia <span>savannas</span> in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. Each year, some East African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance <span>migration</span>, seemingly timed to coincide with local patterns of rainfall and grass growth.</p>

using('connochaetes taurinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The blue wildebeest exhibits <span>sexual dimorphism</span>, with males being larger and darker than females. The blue wildebeest is typically between 170-240 cm (67-94 in) in head-and-body length. The average height of the species is 115-145 cm (45-57 in). While males weigh up to 290 kg (640 lb), females seldom exceed 260 kg (570 lb). A characteristic feature is the long, black tail, which is around 60-100 cm (24-39 in) in length. All features and markings of this species are <span>bilaterally symmetrical</span> for both sexes. The average life span is 20 years in the wild and 21 years in captivity. The oldest known captive individual lived for 24.3 years.</p>

using('connochaetes taurinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This broad-shouldered antelope has a muscular, front-heavy appearance, with a distinctive robust <span>muzzle</span>. Young blue wildebeest are born tawny brown, and begin to take on their adult colouration at the age of two months. The adults' hues range from a deep slate or bluish gray to light gray or even grayish-brown. The back and flanks are slightly lighter than the <span>ventral</span> surface and underparts. Dark brown vertical stripes mark the area between the neck and the back of the ribcage, thus giving it the name "brindled gnu". The manes of both sexes appear long, stiff, thick and jet black, the same colour as the tail and face as well. While the manes of the western and eastern white-bearded wildebeest are lank, those of the Nyassaland wildebeest and common wildebeest stick up. <span>Scent glands</span>, which secrete a clear oil, are present in the forefeet and are larger in males than females.</p>

using('connochaetes taurinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In terms of <span>skull</span> length, the smallest subspecies of the blue wildebeest is the western white-bearded wildebeest. It is also the darkest subspecies, the eastern white-bearded wildebeest being the lightest race. Both these subspecies possess a creamy white beard, whereas the beard is black in both the Nyassaland wildebeest and the common wildebeest. The longest muzzles are found in the Nyassaland wildebeest, and the shortest in female western white-bearded wildebeest.</p>

using('connochaetes taurinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Both sexes possess a pair of large <span>horns</span> which are shaped like <span>parentheses</span>. These extend outward to the side, and then curve upward and inward. In the males, the horns can be 83 cm (33 in) long, while the horns of the females are 30-40 cm (12-16 in) long. Despite being an antelope, the blue wildebeest possesses various <span>bovine</span> characteristics. For instance, the horns resemble those of the female <span>African buffalo</span>. Further, the heavy build and disproportionately large forequarters give it a bovine appearance.</p>

using('connochaetes taurinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Blue wildebeest are mainly found in short grass plains bordering bush-covered acacia savannas in southern and eastern Africa, thriving in areas that are neither too wet nor too arid. They can be found in habitats that vary from overgrazed areas with dense bush to open <span>woodland</span> floodplains. Trees such as <i><span>Brachystegia</span></i> and <i><span>Combretum</span></i> are common in these areas. Blue wildebeest can tolerate arid regions as long as a potable water supply is available, normally within about 15-25 km (9.3-15.5 mi) distance. The southern limit of the blue wildebeest stops at the <span>Orange River</span>, while the western limit is bounded by <span>Lake Victoria</span> and <span>Mt Kenya</span>. The range does not include montane or temperate grasslands. These wildebeest are rarely found at altitudes in excess of 1,800-2,100 m (5,900-6,900 ft). With the exception of a small population of Cookson's wildebeest that occurs in the <span>Luangwa Valley</span> (Zambia), the wildebeest is absent in the wetter parts of the southern savanna country, and particularly is not present in <span>miombo woodlands</span>.</p>

<p>Each year, some East African populations of blue wildebeest take part in a long-distance <span>migration</span>, seemingly timed to coincide with the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of the migration in both directions can vary considerably from year to year. At the end of the rainy season, they migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of drinking water.

<p>The corn crake is a medium-sized rail, 27-30 cm (10.6-11.8 in) long with a wingspan of 42-53 cm (16.5-20.9 in). Males weigh 165 g (5.8 oz) on average and females 145 g (5.1 oz). The adult male has the crown of its head and all of its upperparts brown-black in colour, streaked with buff or grey. The wing <span>coverts</span> are a distinctive chestnut colour with some white bars. The face, neck and breast are blue-grey, apart from a pale brown streak from the base of the bill to behind the eye, the belly is white, and the flanks, and undertail are barred with chestnut and white. The strong bill is flesh-coloured, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Compared to the male, the female has warmer-toned upperparts and a narrower duller eye streak. Outside the breeding season, the upperparts of both sexes become darker and the underparts less grey. The juvenile is like the adult in appearance, but has a yellow tone to its upperparts, and the grey of the underparts is replaced with buff-brown. The chicks have black down, as with all rails. While there are no <span>subspecies</span>, all populations show great individual variation in colouring, and the birds <span>gradually</span> become paler and greyer towards the east of the range. Adults undergo a complete <span>moult</span> after breeding, which is normally finished by late August or early September, before migration to south eastern Africa. There is a pre-breeding partial moult prior to the return from Africa, mainly involving the plumage of the head, body and tail. Young birds have a head and body moult about five weeks after hatching.</p>

<p>The corn crake is <span>sympatric</span> with the African crake on the wintering grounds, but can be distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, <span>tawny</span> upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing. In both the breeding and wintering ranges it is unlikely to be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn crake can resemble a <span>gamebird</span>, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.</p>

<p>This crake migrates to Africa along two main routes: a western route through Morocco and Algeria, and a more important <span>flyway</span> through Egypt. On passage, it has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges, including much of West Africa. Birds from <span>Coll</span> following the western route paused in West Africa on their way further south, and again on the return flight, when they also rested in Spain or North Africa. Eastern migrants have been recorded in those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa. Further afield, the corn crake has been recorded as a <span>vagrant</span> to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Australia, the Seychelles, Bermuda, Canada, the US, Greenland, Iceland, the <span>Faroes</span>, the <span>Azores</span>, <span>Madeira</span>, and the <span>Canary Islands</span>.</p>

<p>The corn crake is a difficult bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual crake on the Scottish island of <span>Tiree</span> entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering <span>Barra</span> bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African crake, and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn crake is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so than that of the African crake. For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than 50 m (150 ft), frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this crake will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.</p>

using('crex crex')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The female may be offered food by the male during courtship. He has a brief courtship display in which the neck is extended and the head held down, the tail is fanned, and the wings are spread with the tips touching the ground. He will then attempt to approach the female from behind, and then leap on her back to copulate. The nest is typically in grassland, sometimes in safer sites along a hedge, or near an isolated tree or bush, or in overgrown vegetation. Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season, the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation, with the second brood in hay. The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first, to take advantage of the later-developing grasses further up a hill. The nest, well hidden in the grass, is built in a scrape or hollow in the ground. It is made of woven coarse dry grass and other plants, and lined with finer grasses. Although nest construction is usually described as undertaken by the female, a recent aviary study found that in the captive population the male always built the nest.</p>

<p>Until 2010, despite a breeding range estimated at 12,400,000 km (4,800,000 mi), the corn crake was classified as <span>near threatened</span> on the <span>IUCN Red List</span> because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased. It is therefore now classed as <span>least concern</span>, since the major populations in Russia and Kazakhstan are not expected to change much in the short term. There are an estimated 1.3-2.0 million breeding pairs in Europe, three-quarters of which are in European Russia, and a further 515,000-1,240,000 pairs in Asiatic Russia; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5.45 and 9.72 million individuals. In much of the western half of its range, there have been long-term declines that are expected to continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including a five-fold increase in Finland, and a doubling in the UK. In the Netherlands, there were 33 breeding territories in 1996, but this number had increased to at least 500 by 1998.</p>

The African crake feeds on a wide range of <span>invertebrates</span>, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large <span>birds of prey</span>; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host <span>parasites</span>. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.</p>

<p>The African crake is a smallish crake, 20-23 cm (7.8-9.1 in) long with a 40-42 cm (15.7-16.5 in) wingspan. The male has blackish upperparts streaked with olive-brown, apart from the nape and hindneck which are plain pale brown; there is a white streak from the base of the bill to above the eye. The sides of the head, foreneck, throat and breast are bluish-grey, the <span>flight feathers</span> are dark brown, and the flanks and sides of the belly are barred black and white. The eye is red, the bill is reddish, and the legs and feet are light brown or grey. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the female is slightly smaller and duller than the male, with a less contrasting head pattern. Immature birds have darker and duller upperparts than the adult, a dark bill, grey eye, and less barring on the underparts. There are no <span>subspecific</span> or other geographical variations in plumage. This crake has a complete <span>moult</span> after breeding, mainly prior to migration. Although this species occurs in fairly open habitats, it lacks the pure white undertail used for signalling in open water or <span>gregarious</span> species like the <span>coots</span> and <span>moorhens</span>.</p>

<p>The African crake is larger than the corn crake, which also has darker upperparts, a plain grey face and different underparts barring pattern. In flight, the African species has shorter, blunter wings with a less prominent white leading edge, and deeper wingbeats than its relative. Other <span>sympatric</span> crakes are smaller with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and a shorter bill.

The burrow consists of a long passage with side alleys and several chambers, one for sleeping and the others for storage. The Gambian pouched rat reaches <span>sexual maturity</span> at 5-7 months of age. It has up to four litters every nine months, with up to six offspring in each litter.

<p>The spotted hyena is a highly successful animal, being the most common large <span>carnivore</span> in Africa. Its success is due in part to its adaptability and <span>opportunism</span>; it is primarily a <span>hunter</span> but may also <span>scavenge</span>, with the capacity to eat and digest skin, bone and other animal waste. In functional terms, the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores. The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores; it hunts alone, in small parties of 2-5 individuals or in large groups. During a hunt, spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack. Once selected, their prey is chased over long distance, often several kilometres, at speeds of up to 60 km/h.</p>

using('crocuta crocuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The spotted hyena has a long history of interaction with <span>humanity</span>; depictions of the species exist from the <span>Upper Paleolithic</span> period, with carvings and paintings from the <span>Lascaux</span> and <span>Chauvet Caves</span>. The species has a largely negative reputation in both <span>Western culture</span> and <span>African folklore</span>. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, and foolish, yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of <span>Aristotle</span> and <span>Pliny the Elder</span>, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the <i><span>Physiologus</span></i>, where the animal is depicted as a <span>hermaphrodite</span> and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.</p>

<p>The ancestors of the genus <i>Crocuta</i> diverged from <i><span>Hyaena</span></i> (the genus of <span>striped</span> and <span>brown hyenas</span>) 10 million years ago. The ancestors of the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their <span>evolution</span>, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, as is the case for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the <span>Cromerian</span> period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of <i><span>Pachycrocuta brevirostris</span></i>, the giant short-faced hyena. As there is no evidence of environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.</p>

using('crocuta crocuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The spotted hyena has a strong and well developed neck and forequarters, but relatively underdeveloped hindquarters. The <span>rump</span> is rounded rather than angular, which prevents attackers coming from behind from getting a firm grip on it. The head is wide and flat with a blunt muzzle and broad <span>rhinarium</span>. In contrast to the striped hyena, the ears of the spotted hyena are rounded rather than pointed. Each foot has four digits, which are webbed and armed with short, stout and blunt claws. The paw-pads are broad and very flat, with the whole undersurface of the foot around them being naked. The tail is relatively short, being 300-350 mm (12-14 in) long, and resembles a <span>pompom</span> in appearance. Unusually among hyaenids, and mammals in general, the female spotted hyena is considerably larger than the male. Both sexes have a pair of <span>anal glands</span> which open into the <span>rectum</span> just inside the anal opening. These glands produce <span>a white, creamy secretion</span> which is pasted onto grass stalks by everting the rectum. The odour of this secretion is very strong, smelling of boiling cheap <span>soap</span> or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The spotted hyena has a proportionately large <span>heart</span>, constituting close to 1% of its body weight, thus giving it great endurance in long chases. In contrast, a lion's heart makes up only 0.45-0.57 percent of its body weight. The now extinct Eurasian populations were distinguished from the modern African populations by their shorter distal extremities and longer <span>humerus</span> and <span>femur</span>.</p>

using('crocuta crocuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The skull of the spotted hyena differs from that of the striped hyena by its much greater size and narrower <span>sagittal crest</span>. For its size, the spotted hyena has one of the most powerfully built skulls among the Carnivora. The dentition is more dual purposed than that of other modern hyena species, which are mostly scavengers; the upper and lower third <span>premolars</span> are conical bone-crushers, with a third bone-holding cone jutting from the lower fourth premolar. The spotted hyena also has its <span>carnassials</span> situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80 <span>kgf/cm2</span> (1140 <span>lbf/in&#xB2;</span>), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate. The jaws of the spotted hyena outmatch those of the <span>brown bear</span> in bonecrushing ability, and free ranging hyenas have been observed to crack open the long bones of <span>giraffes</span> measuring 7 cm in diameter. A 63.1 kg (138.8 lb) spotted hyena is estimated to have a bite force of 565.7 newtons at the canine tip and 985.5 newtons at the carnassial eocone.</p>

<p>Fur colour varies greatly and changes with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and brown hyena, that of the spotted hyena consists of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed on the back and hind quarters. The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, deep brown or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly 20 mm (0.79 in) in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present on the back of the neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the back portion of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring 15-20 mm (0.59-0.79 in)) and long, stout bristle hairs (30-40 mm (1.2-1.6 in)). European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts.</p>

<p>Territory size is highly variable, ranging from less than 40 km&#xB2; in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000 km&#xB2; in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and boundary patrols. Clans <span>mark their territories</span> by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses into another clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males are more likely to enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted into another clan after a long period of time if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills.</p>

using('crocuta crocuta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The spotted hyena is a non-seasonal breeder, though a birth peak does occur during the <span>wet season</span>. Females are polyestrus, with an <span>estrus</span> period lasting two weeks. Like many <span>felid</span> species, the spotted hyena is <span>promiscuous</span>, and no enduring <span>pair bonds</span> are formed. Members of both sexes may copulate with several mates over the course of several years. Males will show submissive behaviour when approaching females in heat, even if the male outweighs his partner. Females usually favour younger males born or joined into the clan after they were born. Older females show a similar preference, with the addition of preferring males with whom they have had long and friendly prior relationships. Passive males tend to have greater success in courting females than aggressive ones. Copulation in spotted hyenas is a relatively short affair, lasting 4-12 minutes, and typically only occurs at night with no other hyenas present. The mating process is complicated, as the male's penis enters and exits the female's reproductive tract through <span>her pseudo-penis</span> rather than directly through the <span>vagina</span>, which is blocked by the false scrotum and testes. These unusual traits make mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals, while also ensuring that <span>rape</span> is physically impossible. Once the female retracts her clitoris, the male enters the female by sliding beneath her, an operation facilitated by the penis's upward angle. Once this is accomplished, a <span>typical mammalian mating posture</span> is adopted.</p>

<p>Cubs are born with soft, brownish black hair, and weigh 1.5 kg on average. Unique among carnivorous mammals, spotted hyenas are also born with their eyes open and with 6-7 mm long canine teeth and 4 mm long incisors. Also, cubs will attack each other shortly after birth. This is particularly apparent in same sexed litters, and can result in the death of the weaker cub. This neonatal <span>siblicide</span> kills an estimated 25% of all hyenas in their first month. Male cubs which survive grow faster and are likelier to achieve reproductive dominance, while female survivors eliminate rivals for dominance in their natal clan. Lactating females can carry 3-4 kg (6.5-9 lb) of milk in their <span>udders</span>. Spotted hyena milk has the highest <span>protein</span> content of any terrestrial carnivore, and its <span>fat</span> content is second only to that of the <span>polar bear</span> and <span>sea otter</span>. Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12-16 months, though they can process solid food as early as three months. Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young. Females are very protective of their cubs, and will not tolerate other adults, particularly males, approaching them. Spotted hyenas exhibit adult behaviours very early in life; cubs have been observed to ritually sniff each other and mark their living space before the age of one month. Within ten days of birth, they are able to move at considerable speed. Cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted, lighter coloured pelage of the adults at 2-3 months. They begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at the age of eight months, and will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year. Spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at the age of three years. The average lifespan in zoos is 12 years, with a maximum of 25 years.</p>

<p>In areas where spotted hyenas and <span>lions</span> are sympatric, the two species occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can be as high as 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it's the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the <span>Ngorongoro Crater</span>, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30-100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in <span>Etosha</span>. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently <span>mobbing</span> lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.</p>

<p><span>Jackals</span> will feed alongside hyenas, though they will be chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating jackal flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a <span>golden jackal</span>. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other when there is no food or young at stake.</p>

<p>The spotted hyena has an extensive vocal range, with sounds ranging from whoops, fast whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, soft grunt-laughs, loud grunt-laughs, whines and soft squeals. The loud "who-oop" call, along with the maniacal laughter, are among the most recognisable sounds of Africa. Typically, very high-pitched calls indicate fear or submission, while loud, lower-pitched calls express aggression. The pitch of the laugh indicates the hyena's age, while variations in the frequency of notes used when hyenas make noises convey information about the animal's social rank.</p>

<p>Spotted hyenas may contract <span>brucellosis</span>, <span>rinderpest</span> and <span>anaplasmosis</span>. They are vulnerable to <i><span>Trypanosoma congolense</span></i>, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from <span>tsetse flies</span>. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have <span>antibodies</span> against <span>rabies</span>, <span>canine herpes</span>, <span>canine brucella</span>, <span>canine parvovirus</span>, <span>feline calici</span>, <span>leptospirosis</span>, <span>bovine brucella</span>, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the <span>canine distemper</span> outbreak of 1993-1994, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were more closely related to each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The <span>microfilaria</span> of <i><span>Dipetalonema dracuneuloides</span></i> have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three <span>cestode</span> species of the genus <i><span>Taenia</span></i>, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries <span>protozoan</span> parasites of the genus <i><span>Hepatozoon</span></i> in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores ; <i><span>Taenia hyaenae</span></i> and <i>T. olnogojinae</i> occur in hyenas in their adult phase. <i><span>Trichinella spiralis</span></i> are found as <span>cysts</span> in hyena muscles.</p>

<p>The spotted hyena (<span>cave hyena</span> subspecies) is depicted in a few examples of <span>Upper Palaeolithic</span> rock art in <span>France</span>. A painting from the <span>Chauvet Cave</span> depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern.

In <span>Lascaux</span>, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present in the part of the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and is depicted in profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in <span>Ari&#xE8;ge</span> shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal&#x2019;s forelimb on the proximal side.

An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in <span>Dordogne</span> shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a <span>smile</span>.

<p>Several authors during the <span>Scramble for Africa</span> attested that, despite its physical strength, the spotted hyena poses no danger to hunters when captured or cornered. It was often the case that native <span>skinners</span> refused to even touch hyena carcasses, though this was not usually a problem, as hyena skins were not considered attractive. In Burkina Faso, the hyena's tail is used for medicinal and magical purposes. In Cameroon, C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire and Senegal, the animals' whole body is harvested for <span>bushmeat</span> and medicine. In Malawi and Tanzania, the genitalia, nose tips and tails are used for traditional medicine. In Mozambique, traditional healers use various spotted hyena body parts, particularly the paws. <span>Oromo</span> hunters typically go through ritual purification after killing hyenas. Kujamaat hunters traditionally treat the spotted hyenas they kill with the same respect due to deceased tribal elders, in order to avoid retribution from hyena spirits acting on behalf of the dead animal. During the early years of Dutch colonisation in southern Africa, hyenas (referred to as "wolves" by the colonists) were especially susceptible to <span>trapping</span>, as their prediliction for carrion and lack of caution about enclosed spaces worked against them. A feature of many frontier farms was the <i>wolwehok</i> (hyena trap), which was roughly constructed from stone or wood and baited with meat. The trap featured a trap-door, which was designed to shut once the bait was disturbed. In the <span>Cape Colony</span>, spotted hyenas were often hunted by tracking them to their dens and shooting them as they escaped. Another hunting method was to trap them in their dens and dazzle them with torchlight, before stabbing them in the heart with a long knife. When chased by <span>hunting dogs</span>, spotted hyenas often turn on their attackers, unless the dogs are of exceptionally large, powerful breeds. <span>James Stevenson-Hamilton</span> wrote that wounded spotted hyenas could be dangerous adversaries for hunting dogs, recording an incident in which a hyena managed to kill a dog with a single bite to the neck without breaking the skin. Further difficulties in killing spotted hyenas with dogs include the species' thick skin, which prevents dogs from inflicting serious damage to the animal's muscles.</p>

<p>During the 19th century, the species was frequently displayed in travelling <span>circuses</span> as oddities. <span>Alfred Brehm</span> wrote that the spotted hyena is harder to tame than the striped hyena, and that performing specimens in circuses were not up to standard. <span>Sir John Barrow</span> described how spotted hyenas in <span>Sneeuberge</span> were trained to hunt game, writing that they were "as faithful and diligent as any of the common domestic dogs". In Tanzania, spotted hyena cubs may be taken from a communal den by <span>witchdoctors</span>, in order to increase their social status. An April 2004 <span>BBC</span> article described how a shepherd living in the small town of Qabri Bayah about 50 kilometres from <span>Jigjiga</span>, Ethiopia managed to use a male spotted hyena as a <span>livestock guardian dog</span>, suppressing its urge to leave and find a mate by feeding it special herbs. If not raised with adult members of their kind, captive spotted hyenas will exhibit scent marking behaviours much later in life than wild specimens. Although easily tamed, spotted hyenas are exceedingly difficult to <span>house train</span>, and can be very destructive; a captive, otherwise perfectly tame, specimen in the <span>Tower of London</span> managed to tear an 8-foot (2.4 m) long plank nailed to its recently repaired enclosure floor with no apparent effort. During the research leading to the composition of his monograph <i>The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behavior,</i> Hans Kruuk kept a tame hyena he named Solomon. Kruuk found Solomon's company so congenial, he would have kept him, but Solomon had an insatiable taste for "cheese in the bar of the tourist lounge and bacon off the Chief Park Warden's breakfast table," and no door could hold him back, so Solomon was obliged to live out his days in the <span>Edinburgh Zoo</span>.</p>

<p>Common mole rats are endothermic, having the ability to generate their own heat and keep their body temperature above ambient temperature.

These mole rats also have long sensory hairs called Vibrissae that stand out from the pelage (fur covering) over their body.</p>

using('cuculus canorus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The common cuckoo is 32-34 centimetres (13-13 in) long from bill to tail (with a tail of 13-15 centimetres (5.1-5.9 in) and a wingspan of 55-60 centimetres (22-24 in). The legs are short. It is greyish with a slender body and long tail and can be mistaken for a <span>falcon</span> in flight, where the wingbeats are regular. During the breeding season, common cuckoos often settle on an open perch with drooped wings and raised tail. There is a <span>rufous</span> <span>colour morph</span>, which occurs occasionally in adult females but more often in juveniles.</p>

using('cuculus canorus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>As the common cuckoo evolves to lay eggs that better imitate the host's eggs, the host species adapts and is more able to distinguish the cuckoo egg. A study of 248 common cuckoo and host eggs demonstrated that female cuckoos that parasitised common redstart nests laid eggs that matched better than those that targeted dunnocks. <span>Spectroscopy</span> was used to model how the host species saw the cuckoo eggs. Cuckoos that target dunnock nests lay white, brown-speckled eggs, in contrast to the dunnock's own blue eggs. The theory suggests that common redstarts have been parasitised by common cuckoos for longer, and so have evolved to be better than the dunnocks at noticing the cuckoo eggs.</p>

using('cuculus canorus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Species whose broods are parasitised by the common cuckoo have evolved to discriminate against cuckoo eggs but not chicks. Experiments have shown that common cuckoo chicks persuade their host parents to feed them by making a rapid <span>begging call</span> that sounds <i>"remarkably like a whole brood of host chicks."</i> The researchers suggested that <i>"the cuckoo needs vocal trickery to stimulate adequate care to compensate for the fact that it presents a visual stimulus of just one gape."</i> However, a cuckoo chick needs the amount of food of a whole brood of host nestlings, and it struggles to elicit that much from the host parents with only the vocal stimulus. This may reflect a tradeoff - the cuckoo chick benefits from eviction by receiving all the food provided, but faces a cost in being the only one influencing feeding rate. For this reason, cuckoo chicks exploit host parental care by remaining with the host parent longer than host chicks do, both before and after fledging.</p>

<p>Topi resemble <span>hartebeest</span> but have a darker coloration and lack sharply angled horns. They have elongated heads, a distinct hump at the base of the neck, and reddish brown bodies with dark purple patchings on their upper legs. They also have a mask-like dark coloration on the face. Their horns are ringed and <span>lyrate</span> shaped. Their coats are made of short, shiny hairs. They range in mass from 68 to 160 kg (150 to 353 lb). Head-and-body length can range from 150 to 210 cm (59 to 83 in) and the tail measures 40-60 cm (16-24 in). They are a tall species, ranging in height from 100 to 130 cm (39 to 51 in) at the shoulder. Males tend to be larger and darker than females. Topi also have <span>preorbital glands</span> that secrete clear oil and the front legs have hoof glands.

<p>Topi primarily live in grassland habitats ranging from treeless plains to savannas. In <span>ecotone</span> habitats between woodlands and open grasslands, they stay along the edge using the shade in hot weather. They prefer pastures with green grass that is medium in length with leaf-like swards. Topis are more densely populated in areas where green plants last into the dry season, particularly near water. The topi is a selective feeder and uses its elongated muzzle and flexible lips to forage for the freshest plants. When foraging for food topi tend to make small bites at a fast rate. Topi generally frequent flat lowlands and at elevations below 1500 m. When they have access to enough green vegetation, topi usually do not have to drink. They drink more when relying on dry grass. Topi use <span>vantage points</span>, such as <span>termite mounds</span>, to get a good look at their surroundings.</p>

using('damaliscus korrigum')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Topi are usually either numerous or absent in an area. Scattered populations do not last long and either increase or die off.

It has mainly reddish brown <span>plumage</span>, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, <span>paddy fields</span> or other <span>wetlands</span> with plentiful vegetation.</p>

using('dendrocygna bicolor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The <span>whistling ducks</span>, <i>Dendrocygna</i>, are a distinctive group of eight bird species within the duck, goose and swan family <span>Anatidae</span>, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the <span>Late Miocene</span> before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the <span>Pliocene</span> and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a <span>superspecies</span> with the <span>wandering whistling duck</span>. It has no recognised <span>subspecies</span>, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US have in the past been assigned to <i>D. b. helva</i>, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than <i>D. b. bicolor</i>.</p>

using('dendrocygna bicolor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The fulvous whistling duck is 45-53 cm (18-21 in) long; the male weighs 748-1,050 g (26.4-37.0 oz), and the female averages marginally lighter at 712-1,000 g (25.1-35.3 oz). It is a long-legged duck, mainly golden-brown with a darker back and an obvious blackish line down the back of its neck. It has whitish stripes on its flanks, a long grey bill and grey legs. In flight, the wings are brown above and black below, with no white markings, and a white crescent on the rump contrasts with the black tail. All plumages are fairly similar, but the female is slightly smaller and duller-plumaged than the male. The juvenile has paler underparts, and appears generally duller, especially on the flanks. There is a complete wing <span>moult</span> after breeding, and birds then seek the cover of dense wetland vegetation while they are flightless. Body feathers may be moulted throughout the year, although each feather is replaced only once annually.</p>

<p>The longest known black rhinoceros horn measured nearly 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length. Sometimes, a third, smaller horn may develop.

The black rhino is smaller than the <span>white rhino</span> and has a pointed and prehensile upper lip, which it uses to grasp leaves and twigs when feeding. The white rhinoceros has square lips used for eating grass. The black rhinoceros can also be distinguished from the white rhinoceros by its size, smaller skull, and ears; and by the position of the head, which is held higher than the white rhinoceros, since the black rhinoceros is a browser and not a grazer. This key differentiation is further illustrated by the shape of the two species mouths (lips): the "square" lip of the white rhinoceros is an adaptation for grazing, and the "hooked" lip of the black rhinoceros is an adaptation to help browsing.</p>

<p>The <b>wandering albatross</b>, <b>snowy albatross</b> or <b>white-winged albatross</b> (<i>Diomedea exulans</i>), is a large <span>seabird</span> from the <span>family</span> <span>Diomedeidae</span>, which has a circumpolar range in the <span>Southern Ocean</span>. It was the first species of albatross to be described, and was long considered the same species as the <span>Tristan albatross</span> and the <span>Antipodean albatross</span>. In fact, a few authors still consider them all subspecies of the same species. The <span>SACC</span> has a proposal on the table to split this species, and <span>BirdLife International</span> has already split it. Together with the <span>Amsterdam albatross</span> it forms the wandering albatross <span>species complex</span>. The wandering albatross is the largest member of the <span>genus</span> <i>Diomedea</i> (the <span>great albatrosses</span>), one of the <span>largest birds in the world</span>, and one of the best known and studied species of bird in the world.</p>

using('diomedea exulans')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The wandering albatross has the largest wingspan of any living bird, typically ranging from 2.51 to 3.5 m (8 ft 3 in to 11 ft 6 in), with a mean span of 3.1 m (10 ft 2 in) in the <span>Bird Island, South Georgia</span> colony and an average of exactly 3 m (9 ft 10 in) in 123 birds measured off the coast of <span>Malabar, New South Wales</span>. The longest-winged examples verified have been about 3.7 m (12 ft 2 in). Even larger examples have been claimed, with two giants reportedly measuring 4.22 m (13 ft 10 in) and 5.3 m (17 ft 5 in) but these reports remain unverified. As a result of its wingspan, it is capable of remaining in the air without flapping its wings for several hours at a time (travelling 22 m for every metre of drop). The length of the body is about 107 to 135 cm (3 ft 6 in to 4 ft 5 in) with females being slightly smaller than males. Adults can weigh from 5.9 to 12.7 kg (13 to 28 lb), although most will weigh 6.35 to 11.91 kg (14.0 to 26.3 lb). Immature birds have been recorded weighing as much as 16.1 kg (35 lb) during their first flights (at which time they may still have fat reserves that will be shed as they continue to fly). The <span>plumage</span> varies with age, with the juveniles starting chocolate brown. As they age they become whiter. The adults have white bodies with black and white wings. Males have whiter wings than females with just the tips and trailing edges of the wings black. They also show a faint peach spot on the side of the head. The wandering albatross is the whitest of the wandering albatross species complex, the other species having a great deal more brown and black on the wings and body as breeding adults, very closely resembling immature wandering albatrosses. The large bill is pink, as are the feet. They also have a <span>salt gland</span> that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>

using('diomedea exulans')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The wandering albatross breeds every other year. At breeding time they occupy loose <span>colonies</span> on isolated island groups in the <span>Southern Ocean</span>. They lay one egg that is white, with a few spots, and is about 10 cm (3.9 in) long. They lay this egg between 10 December and 5 January. The nests are a large bowl built of grassy vegetation and soil peat, that is 1 metre wide at the base and half a metre wide at the apex. Incubation takes about 11 weeks and both parents are involved. They are a <span>monogamous</span> species, usually for life. Adolescents return to the colony within 6 years; however they won't start breeding until 11 to 15 years. About 30% of <span>fledglings</span> survive.</p>

<p>Sailors used to capture the birds for their long wing bones, which they manufactured into tobacco-pipe stems. The early explorers of the great Southern Sea cheered themselves with the companionship of the albatross in their dreary solitudes; and the evil fate of him who shot with his cross-bow the "bird of good omen" is familiar to readers of <span>Coleridge</span>'s <i><span>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</span></i>. The metaphor of "an albatross around his neck" also comes from the poem and indicates an unwanted burden causing anxiety or hindrance. In the days of sail the bird often accompanied ships for days, not merely following it, but wheeling in wide circles around it without ever being observed to land on the water. It continued its flight, apparently untired, in tempestuous as well as moderate weather.</p>

<p>The male Golden-winged Sunbird is about 9 in (23 cm) long and the female is about 6 in (15 cm) long, the male having long central tail feathers. Yellow-edged feathers in the wings and tail are key identification pointers in all plumages of both the male and female. Body feathers of the male in breeding condition are a conspicuous metallic reddish-copper colour, which are mostly replaced by dull-black feathers in the non-breeding condition. The underparts of the male are brownish-black. The female is olive above and yellowish below. Immature are similar to females, except their underparts are darker.</p>

using('drepanorhynchus reichenowi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Usually territories involve only a single resident individual. Occasionally, a female can coexist with a male on a large territory and participate in its defence. Such sharing may relate to a complex prolonged pattern of pair formation. Feeding territories may be defended by all age and sex classes of the Golden-winged Sunbirds, including juveniles. The birds defend their territories both intra-specifically and inter-specifically against all sunbird species in the area. The success of the defence depends in part on the <span>dominance</span> relationships of the intruding individual, where persistent individuals of larger bird species such as the <span>Bronzy Sunbird</span> may feed successfully. Territory sizes vary greatly, ranging from 6.7 to 2300 m, but each territory contains about the same number of flowers.</p>

<p>This bird resembles a <span>plover</span>, but has very long grey legs and a strong heavy black bill similar to a <span>tern</span>. Its black-and-white plumage and long-necked upright posture with heavy bill makes it distinctive and unmistakable. Its bill is unique among waders, and specialised for eating crabs. It has partially webbed toes. The plumage is white except for black on its back and in the primary feathers of the wings. They are noisy birds, calling frequently on their breeding sites and in their wintering grounds. The usual call is a <i>ka</i> similar to that of the <span>bar-tailed godwit</span> but repeated rapidly. Flocks may produce a whinnying sound that rises and at in the breeding season produce whistling <i>kew-ki-ki</i> notes.</p>

using('dromas ardeola')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]

<p>The crab-plover is unusual for waders in that it nests in <span>burrows</span> in sandy banks. In the Red Sea region, the breeding season begins around the middle of May. It is a <span>colonial</span> breeder, nesting in colonies as large 1500 pairs. It lays one white <span>egg</span>, occasionally two, which are large for its body size. The nest burrow temperature is optimal due to solar radiation and the parents are able to leave the nest unattended for as long as 58 hours. The chicks are also unique for the usually <span>nidifugous</span> waders in being <span>unable to walk</span> and remain in the nest for several days after hatching, having food brought to them. Even once they <span>fledge</span> they have a long period of parental care afterwards. Both males and females take care of the young.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The dugong has been hunted for thousands of years for its <span>meat</span> and <span>oil</span>. Traditional hunting has great cultural significance throughout its range. The dugong's current distribution is reduced and disjunct, and many populations are close to extinction. The <span>IUCN</span> lists the dugong as a species vulnerable to extinction, while the <span>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</span> limits or bans the trade of derived products. Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain <span>anthropogenic</span> and include hunting, habitat degradation, and fishing-related fatalities. With its long lifespan of 70 years or more, and slow rate of reproduction, the dugong is especially vulnerable to extinction.</p>

<p>The dugong's tail flukes and flippers are similar to those of dolphins. These flukes are raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. The dugong lacks <span>nails</span> on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugong's body length. The tail has deep notches.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A dugong's brain weighs a maximum of 300 g (11 oz), about 0.1% of the animal's body weight. With very small eyes, dugongs have limited vision, but acute hearing within narrow sound thresholds. Their ears, which lack <span>pinna</span>, are located on the sides of their head. The nostrils are located on top of the head and can be closed using valves. Dugongs have two <span>teats</span>, one located behind each flipper. There are few differences between sexes; the body structures are almost the same. A male's <span>testes</span> are not externally located, and the main difference between males and females is the location of the <span>genital</span> aperture in relation to the <span>umbilicus</span> and the <span>anus</span>. The <span>lungs</span> in a dugong are very long, extending almost as far as the <span>kidneys</span>, which are also highly elongated in order to cope with the saltwater environment. If wounded, a dugong's blood will clot rapidly.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The skull of a dugong is unique. The skull is enlarged with sharply down-turned <span>premaxilla</span>, which are stronger in males. The spine has between 57 and 60 <span>vertebrae</span>. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two <span>incisors</span> (<span>tusks</span>) which emerge in males during puberty. The female's tusks continue to grow without emerging during puberty, sometimes erupting later in life after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong, and the cheekteeth move forward with age.

Like other sirenians, the dugong experiences <span>pachyostosis</span>, a condition in which the ribs and other long bones are unusually solid and contain little or no marrow. These heavy bones, which are among the densest in the <span>animal kingdom</span>, may act as a <span>ballast</span> to help keep sirenians suspended slightly below the water's surface.</p>

<p>Dugongs are found in warm coastal waters from the western Pacific Ocean to the eastern coast of Africa, along an estimated 140,000 kilometres (86,992 mi) of coastline between 26&#xB0; and 27&#xB0; degrees to the north and south of the <span>equator</span>. Their historic range is believed to correspond to that of seagrasses from the <span>Potamogetonaceae</span> and <span>Hydrocharitaceae</span> families. The full size of the former range is unknown, although it is believed that the current populations represent the historical limits of the range, which is highly fractured. The dugong is the only strictly-marine herbivorous mammal, as all species of manatee utilise fresh water to some degree. Recorded numbers of dugongs are generally believed to be lower than actual numbers, due to a lack of accurate surveys. Despite this, the dugong population is thought to be shrinking, with a worldwide decline of 20 per cent in the last 90 years. They have disappeared from the waters of <span>Hong Kong</span>, <span>Mauritius</span>, and Taiwan, as well as parts of <span>Cambodia</span>, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam.

<p>Dugongs are semi-nomadic, often travelling long distances in search of food, but staying within a certain range their entire life. Large numbers often move together from one area to another. It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability. Their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels. Dugong movements mostly occur within a localised area of seagrass beds, and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement. Daily movement is affected by the tides. In areas where there is a large tidal range, dugongs travel with the tide in order to access shallower feeding areas. In Moreton Bay, dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters. At higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter. Occasionally individual dugongs make long-distance travels over many days, and can travel over deep ocean waters. One animal was seen as far south as <span>Sydney</span>. Although they are marine creatures, dugongs have been known to travel up creeks, and in one case a dugong was caught 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) up a creek near <span>Cooktown</span>.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Dugongs, along with other sirenians, are referred to as "<span>sea cows</span>" because their diet consists mainly of sea-grass. When eating they ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although when this is impossible they will feed on just the leaves. A wide variety of seagrass has been found in dugong stomach contents, and evidence exists they will eat <span>algae</span> when seagrass is scarce. Although almost completely <span>herbivorous</span>, they will occasionally eat <span>invertebrates</span> such as <span>jellyfish</span>, <span>sea squirts</span>, and <span>shellfish</span>. Dugongs in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as <span>polychaetes</span> or marine algae when the supply of their choice grasses decreases. In other southern areas of both western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. This does not apply to dugongs in tropical areas, in which faecal evidence indicates that invertebrates are not eaten.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Most dugongs do not feed from lush areas, but where the seagrass is more sparse. Additional factors such as protein concentration and regenerative ability also affect the value of a seagrass bed. The chemical structure and composition of the seagrass is important, and the grass species most often eaten are low in fibre, high in nitrogen, and easily digestible. In the Great Barrier Reef, dugongs feed on low-fibre high-nitrogen seagrass such as <i><span>Halophila</span></i> and <i><span>Halodule</span></i>, so as to maximize nutrient intake instead of bulk eating. Seagrasses of a lower <span>seral</span> are preferred, where the area has not fully vegetated. Only certain seagrass meadows are suitable for dugong consumption, due to the dugong's highly specialised diet. There is evidence that dugongs actively alter seagrass species compositions at local levels. Dugongs may search out deeper seagrass. Feeding trails have been observed as deep as 33 metres (108 ft), and dugongs have been seen feeding as deep as 37 metres (121 ft). Dugongs are relatively slow moving, swimming at around 10 kilometres per hour (6.2 mph). When moving along the seabed to feed they walk on their pectoral fins.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Due to their poor eyesight, dugongs often use smell to locate edible plants. They also have a strong tactile sense, and feel their surroundings with their long sensitive bristles. They will dig up an entire plant and then shake it to remove the sand before eating it. They have been known to collect a pile of plants in one area before eating them. The flexible and muscular upper lip is used to dig out the plants. This leaves furrows in the sand in their path.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A dugong reaches sexual maturity between the ages of eight and eighteen, older than in most other mammals. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, with some studies placing the age between ten and seventeen years, while others place it as early as six years. There is evidence that male dugongs lose fertility at older ages. Despite the longevity of the dugong, which may live for 50 years or more, females give birth only a few times during their life, and invest considerable parental care in their young. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2.4 to 7 years.</p>

using('dugong dugon')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Females give birth after a 13-15 month <span>gestation</span>, usually to just one calf. Birth occurs in very shallow water, with occasions known where the mothers were almost on the shore. As soon as the young is born the mother pushes it to the surface to take a breath. Newborns are already 1.2 metres (4 ft) long and weigh around 30 kilograms (66 lb). Once born, they stay close to their mothers, possibly to make swimming easier. The calf nurses for 14-18 months, although it begins to eat seagrasses soon after birth. A calf will only leave its mother once it has matured.</p>

<p>Despite being legally protected in many countries, the main causes of population decline remain <span>anthropogenic</span> and include hunting, habitat degradation, and fishing-related fatalities. Entanglement in fishing nets has caused many deaths, although there are no precise statistics. Most issues with industrial fishing occur in deeper waters where dugong populations are low, with local fishing being the main risk in shallower waters. As dugongs cannot stay underwater for a very long period, they are highly prone to deaths due to entanglement. The use of <span>shark nets</span> has historically caused large numbers of deaths, and they have been eliminated in most areas and replaced with baited hooks. Hunting has historically been a problem too, although in most areas they are no longer hunted, with the exception of certain indigenous communities. In areas such as northern Australia, hunting remains the greatest impact on the dugong population.</p>

The female incubates the eggs for 30 days and when the eggs hatch the chicks are helpless but have soft down covering their body. For the first two weeks or so the female broods the chicks constantly, both day and night. The female does no hunting at all for the first three weeks after hatching, but calls to the male from the nest, and he generally responds by bringing food. The female feeds the chicks with the mice brought back to the nest by the male, feeding them in tiny pieces for the first week or two, at which time the chicks are capable of swallowing a mouse whole. The nestling period lasts around 36 days, and the post-fledging period at least 36 days with parental feeding for at least 22 days. When the chicks are older both parents take it in turns to feed them. Black feathers start to appear along the chicks' wings when they are about a fortnight old, and they are fully <span>fledged</span> and are ready to fly in five weeks. Within a week of leaving the nest the young birds are capable of hunting for mice on their own.</p>

<p>There is a dispute among biologists as to how to properly classify the various species of Zebra.

This is on account of Gr&#xE9;vy's zebra resembling an <span>ass</span> (subgenus <i>Asinus</i>), while the plains zebra and mountain zebra are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus <i>Equus</i> along with other living equids. However, recent <span>phylogenetic</span> evidence suggests that the mountain zebras and Gr&#xE9;vy's zebras to be classified with asses and donkeys in a lineage separate from the Plains zebra. In areas where Plains zebras are <span>sympatric</span> with Gr&#xE9;vy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In <span>captivity</span>, Plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras.

<p>Plains zebra herds will mix and migrate together along with other species such as <span>wildebeests</span>. Wildebeests and zebras generally coexist peacefully and will alert each other to predators. However, aggressive interactions occasionally occur.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Stallions form and expand their harems by abducting young mares from their natal harems. When a mare reaches sexual maturity, she will exhibit the <span>estrous</span> posture, which attracts nearby stallions, both bachelors and harem leaders. Her family stallion (likely her father) will chase off or fight stallions attempting to abduct her. Even after a young mare is isolated from her natal harem, the fight over her continues until her estrous cycle is over, and it starts again with the next estrous cycle. It is rare that the mare's original abductor keeps her for long. When the mare finally <span>ovulates</span>, the male that impregnates her keeps her for good. Thus, the mare becomes a permanent member of a new harem. The estrous posture of a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually non-existent.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Mares exist in a hierarchy, with the alpha female being the first to mate with the stallion and being the one to lead the group. When new mares are added to the group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus, the stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subsides. The most recently added females rank lowest. Females that become unfit or weak may drop in their rank, though. The female memberships of a harem stay intact even if a new stallion takes over. Females in a harem tend to be hostile to outside females. Zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, shoulders, and back with their teeth and lips. Mothers and foals groom the most often, followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behavior.</p>

using('equus quagga')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A stallion will defend his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion would issue a warning to the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion will lie still on the ground as if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, will strike and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.</p>

<p>Birds have often escaped from captivity or been deliberately released. Breeding populations have become established in many places where the climate is sufficiently warm and where there is a sufficient supply of grass seeds. They are now found on many islands around Africa: <span>Saint Helena</span>, <span>Ascension Island</span>, the <span>Cape Verde</span> Islands, <span>S&#xE3;o Tom&#xE9; and Pr&#xED;ncipe</span>, <span>Mauritius</span>, <span>R&#xE9;union</span>, <span>Rodrigues</span>, the <span>Seychelles</span> and <span>Ile Amsterdam</span>. They may possibly be native on some of these islands. In Europe the Common Waxbill has become widespread in <span>Portugal</span> and is spreading through <span>Spain</span>. There are small populations on <span>Madeira</span> and <span>Gran Canaria</span> and it has recently appeared on <span>Tenerife</span> and the <span>Azores</span>. In the <span>Americas</span> waxbills are found in <span>Trinidad</span>, several parts of <span>Brazil</span> and there are a few on <span>Bermuda</span>. In the <span>Pacific</span> there are populations on <span>New Caledonia</span>, <span>Efate</span> Island in <span>Vanuatu</span>, <span>Tahiti</span> and the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span>.

<p>The <span>nest</span> is a large ball of criss-crossed grass stems with a long downward-pointing entrance tube on one side. It is built in a cavity, usually low down amongst dense vegetation. A rudimentary second nest ("cock's nest") may be built on top where the male sleeps. Four to seven white <span>eggs</span> are laid. They are <span>incubated</span> for 11 to 13 days and the young birds <span>fledge</span> 17 to 21 days after hatching. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The timing of the breeding season varies in different parts of the world. Nests may be <span>parasitized</span> by the <span>Pin-tailed Whydah</span> which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches.

<p>The <b>southern right whale</b> (<i>Eubalaena australis</i>) is a <span>baleen whale</span>, one of three species classified as <span>right whales</span> belonging to the genus <i><span>Eubalaena</span></i>. Like other right whales, the southern right whale is readily distinguished from others by the <span>callosities</span> on its head, a broad back without a <span>dorsal fin</span>, and a long arching mouth that begins above the eye. Its skin is very dark grey or black, occasionally with some white patches on the belly. The right whale's callosities appear white due to large colonies of cyamids (<span>whale lice</span>). It is almost indistinguishable from the closely related <span>North Atlantic</span> and the <span>North Pacific right whales</span>, displaying only minor skull differences. It may have fewer callosities on its head and more on its lower lips than the two northern species. Approximately 10,000 southern right whales are spread throughout the southern part of the <span>Southern Hemisphere</span>.</p>

<p>The maximum size of an adult female is 15 m (49 ft) and can weigh up to 47 tonnes (46 long tons; 52 short tons). The testicles of right whales are likely to be the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb). This suggests that <span>sperm competition</span> is important in the mating process. Right whales cannot cross the warm equatorial waters to connect with the other (sub)species and (inter)breed: their thick layers of insulating <span>blubber</span> make it impossible for them to dissipate their internal body heat in tropical waters.</p>

<p>During the 2012 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission's Scientific Committee, data was presented regarding the continued phenomena of southern right whale <span>strandings</span> and high rate of mortality at <span>Pen&#xED;nsula Vald&#xE9;s</span>, <span>Argentina</span>. Between 2003 and 2011, a total of 482 dead right whales were recorded at Pen&#xED;nsula Vald&#xE9;s. There were at least 55 whale deaths in 2010, and 61 in 2011. As in previous years, the vast majority of strandings were calves of the season. There are increasing sightings along <span>Golfo San Jorge</span> and on <span>Tierra del Fuego</span> in recent years.</p>

<p>Southern Right Whales can be found in many parts of southern Australia, with the largest population to be found at the <span>Head of the Bight</span> in <span>South Australia</span>. Over 100 individuals are seen there annually from June to October. Visitors can view the whales from cliff top boardwalks and lookouts, with whales swimming almost directly below. The Head of the Bight is located in a sparsely populated area in the middle of the Nullabor. A more accessible location for viewing whales in South Australia is <span>Encounter Bay</span> where the whales can be seen just off the beaches of the <span>Fleurieu Peninsula</span> centred around the surfing town of <span>Middleton, South Australia</span>. A newer nursery ground has been established on <span>Eyre Peninsula</span> especially at <span>Fowlers Bay</span> as well. Numbers are much smaller at these locations compared to the Bight, with an average of a couple of whales per day. In recent years there have been regular sightings of more than ten whales at a time off Basham Beach. A Whale Centre for information on the history of whaling and now whale watching in the area can be found at <span>Victor Harbor</span>. Whale numbers are scarcer in <span>Victoria</span> that the only established breeding ground where whales use each year had been at <span>Warrnambool</span>, but in very small numbers. However, the whales seem to re-colonize and extending their wintering habitats into other areas as the numbers of whales seen at Warrnambool do not show dramatically increases, but numbers of sightings occurred in other areas are showing slow but good increases. These are around <span>Melbourne</span> such as in <span>Port Phillip Bay</span>, at <span>Ocean Grove</span>, on <span>Mornington Peninsula</span> and in <span>Apollo Bay</span>. <span>Tasmania</span> is also a newer wintering ground showing dramatic increases in recent years. <span>Western Australia</span>, <span>New South Wales</span>, and <span>Queensland</span> coasts once had been normal habitats. Historical range was much wider and was spread on entire coasts of the continent (exclunding along <span>Northern Territory</span>); up to <span>Exmouth</span> and <span>Shark Bay</span> on west coast and <span>Hervey Bay</span> and <span>Moreton Bay</span> on east coast. East coast population is still endangered and very small (in low-tens), contributing in small numbers and limited re-colonization, but increases have been confirmed in many areas such as vicinity to <span>Sydney Harbor</span>, <span>Port Stephens</span>, <span>Twofold Bay</span>, <span>Jervis Bay</span>, at <span>Broulee</span>, <span>Moruya River</span>, <span>Narooma</span>, <span>Byron Bay</span>, and so on.</p>

<p>Many features are still unknown about right whale populations in New Zealand waters. However, studies by <span>Department of Conservation</span> and sightings reported by locals helped to deepen understanding. Scientists used to believe there was a very small, remnant population of southern right whales inhabiting New Zealand's "main" islands (North and South Island), containing probably 11 reproductive females. In winter, whales migrate north to New Zealand waters and large concentrations occasionally visit the southern coasts of South Island. Bay areas along <span>Foveaux Strait</span> from <span>Fiordland</span> region to northern <span>Otago</span> are important breeding habitats for right whales, especially <span>Preservation Inlet</span>, <span>Te Waewae Bay</span>, and <span>Otago Peninsula</span>. Calving activities are observed all around the nation, but with more regularity around North Island shores from <span>Taranaki</span> coast in west to <span>Hawke's Bay</span>, <span>Bay of Plenty</span> in east, and <span>Hauraki Gulf</span> areas such as <span>Firth of Thames</span> or <span>Bay of Islands</span> in north. The population at sub-Antarctic <span>Auckland Islands</span> is showing a remarkable recovery while recovery state in <span>Campbell Islands</span> are slower. Other than a handful of confirmed observations, very little information are available for whether whales still migrating to historical oceanic habitats of <span>Kermadec Islands</span> and <span>Chatham Islands</span>.</p>

<p>The southern right whale has made <span>Hermanus</span>, <span>South Africa</span> one of the world centers for <span>whale watching</span>. During the winter months (June to October), southern right whales come so close to the shoreline that visitors can watch them from the shore as well as from strategically placed hotels. Hermanus also has two boat-based whale watching operators. The town employs a "whale crier" (<span>cf.</span> <span>town crier</span>) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen. Southern right whales can also be watched at other winter breeding grounds. In False Bay whale-watching can be done from the shore or from the boats of licensed operators in Simon's Town. Plettenberg Bay along the Garden Route of South Africa is another mecca for whale watching not only for Southern Rights (July to December)but throughout the year. There are both land based and Ocean Safaris boat based Whale encounters on offer in this beautiful town. Southern right whales can also be seen off the coast of <span>Port Elizabeth</span> with marine eco tours running from the Port Elizabeth harbour, as some southern right whales make Algoa Bay their home for the winter months.</p>

<p>Thomson's gazelles are 55 to 82 cm (22 to 32 in) tall, body length of 80 to 120 cm (31 to 47 in), and weigh 15 to 25 kg (33 to 55 lb) (females), 20 to 35 kg (44 to 77 lb) (males). They have light brown coats with white underparts and distinctive black stripes on the sides. Their horns are long and pointed with slight curvature. The white patch on their rumps extends to underneath the tail, but no further. <span>Grant's gazelles</span> are sometimes mistaken for Thomson's gazelles. Although some Grant's do have the black stripe running across their sides, the white on their rumps always extends above the tail.</p>

using('eudorcas thomsonii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Thomson's gazelles are dependent on short grass. Their numbers are highly concentrated at the beginning of the rains since the grass grows quickly. They follow the larger herbivores, such as <span>plains zebras</span> and <span>blue wildebeests</span> as they mow down the tall grasses. Then, the gazelles spread out more. In the wild, Thomson's gazelles can live 10-15 years. Their major predators are <span>cheetahs</span>, which are able to attain higher speeds, but gazelles can outlast them in long chases and are able to make turns more speedily. This small antelope-gazelle can run extremely fast, from 80 km/h (50 mph), to 96 km/h (60 mph) and zigzag, a peculiarity which often saves it from predators. Sometimes they are also chased by <span>leopards</span>, <span>lions</span> and <span>hyenas</span>, but the gazelles are faster and more agile; these predators attack especially the young or infirm individuals. They can also be devoured by <span>crocodiles</span> and <span>pythons</span>, and their fawns are sometimes the prey of <span>eagles</span>, <span>jackals</span>, and <span>baboons</span>. A noticeable behaviour of Thomson's gazelles is their bounding leap, known as <span>stotting</span> or <span>pronking</span>, used to startle predators and display strength.</p>

using('eudyptes chrysolophus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The macaroni penguin is a large, crested penguin, similar in appearance to other members of the genus <i>Eudyptes</i>. An adult bird has an average length of around 70 cm (28 in); the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex. Males average from 3.3 kg (7 lb) after incubating, or 3.7 kg (8 lb) after moult to 6.4 kg (14 lb) before moult, while females average 3.2 kg (7 lb) after to 5.7 kg (13 lb) before moult. Among standard measurements, the thick bill (from the <span>gape</span>) measures 7 to 8 cm (2.8 to 3.1 in), the <span>culmen</span> being around a centimetre less. The wing, from the shoulder to the tip, is around 20.4 cm (8.0 in) and the tail is 9-10 cm (3.5-3.9 in) long. The head, chin, throat, and upper parts are black and sharply demarcated against the white under parts. The black <span>plumage</span> has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old. The most striking feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead, and extends horizontally backwards to the <span>nape</span>. The flippers are blue-black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge, and mainly white underneath with a black tip and leading edge. The large, bulbous <span>bill</span> is orange-brown. The <span>iris</span> is red and a patch of pinkish bare skin is found from the base of the bill to the eye. The legs and feet are pink. The male and female are similar in appearance, although males tend to be slightly larger. Males also bear relatively larger bills, which average around 6.1 cm (2.4 in) compared to 5.4 cm (2.1 in) in females; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart.</p>

<p>Although the population of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals, a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s, and the disappearance of the species from <span>Isla Recalada</span> in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally <span>Vulnerable</span> by the <span>IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</span>. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are <span>World Heritage Sites</span> for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density.</p>

using('eudyptes chrysolophus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Foraging for food is generally conducted on a daily basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track the movement of the birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10-20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the <span>seabirds</span>, with an estimated take of 9.2 million <span>tonnes</span> of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.</p>

<p>The little penguin was first described by German <span>naturalist</span> <span>Johann Reinhold Forster</span> in 1781. There are several <span>subspecies</span> but a precise classification of these is still a matter of dispute. The <span>holotypes</span> of the subspecies <i>Eudyptula minor variabilis</i> and <i>Eudyptula minor chathamensis</i> are in the collection of the <span>Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</span>. The <span>white-flippered penguin</span> is sometimes considered a subspecies, sometimes a distinct species, and sometimes a <span>morph</span>. As the Australian and <span>Otago</span> (southeastern coast of <span>South Island</span>) little penguins may be a distinct species to which the <span>specific name</span> <i>minor</i> would apply, the white-flippered birds indeed belong to a distinct species, although not exactly as originally assumed.</p>

using('eudyptula minor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like those of all penguins, the little penguin's wings have developed into flippers used for swimming. The little penguin typically grows to between 30 and 33 cm (12 to 13 inches) tall and usually weighs about 1.5 kilogram on average (3.3 pounds). The head and upperparts are blue in colour, with slate-grey ear coverts fading to white underneath, from the chin to the belly. The flippers are blue. The dark grey-black beak is 3-4 cm long, the irises pale silvery- or bluish-grey or hazel, and the feet pink above with black soles and webbing. An immature individual will have a shorter bill and lighter upperparts.</p>

using('eudyptula minor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like most seabirds, they have a long lifespan. The average for the species is 6.5 years, but <span>flipper ringing</span> experiments show in very exceptional cases up to 25 years in captivity.</p>

using('eudyptula minor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>These birds feed by hunting fish, squid and other small sea animals, for which they travel and dive quite extensively. In New Zealand, important prey items include <span>arrow squid</span>, <span>slender sprat</span>, <span>Graham's gudgeon</span>, <span>red cod</span> and <span>ahuru</span>. They are generally inshore feeders. The use of data loggers has provided information of the diving behaviour of little penguins. 50% of their dives go no deeper than 2 m and the mean diving time is 21 seconds. Yet, they are able to dive as deep as 20 m and remained submerged as long as 60 seconds. Little penguins play an important role in the ecosystem as not only a predator to parasites but also a host. Recent studies have shown a new species of feather mite that feeds on the preening oil on the feathers of the penguin.</p>

They are polygynous, where males acquisition of territory is an important determinant in their access to mates. Red-collared widowbirds have a wide range and there is little concern in terms of conservation status.</p>

<p>When Dutch naturalist <span>Pieter Boddaert</span> first described the Red-collared Widowbird from a South African specimen in 1783, he named it <i>Fringilla ardens</i>, assigning it to a <span>genus</span> of <span>Old World</span> <span>finches</span>. In 1829, <span>William John Swainson</span> created <i><span>Euplectes</span></i>, and moved the widowbirds and bishops from <i>Fringilla</i> into this new genus. Traditionally, <i>Euplectes</i> is thought to contain two <span>clades</span>, with the bishops in one clade and the widowbirds in another. However, molecular evidence suggests that the Red-collared Widowbird is actually a long-tailed bishop rather than a true widowbird. In captivity, they have been successfully bred with <span>Southern Red Bishop</span>, <span>Yellow-mantled Widowbird</span>, <span>Fan-tailed Widowbird</span>, and <span>Black-winged Red Bishop</span>.</p>

using('euplectes ardens')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Similar to other widowbirds, male red-collared widowbirds have both seasonal and sexual <span>dimorphism</span>. Males are about 25 cm (9.8 in) in length while females are only 13 centimeters. A similar trend is seen with weight, where males range from 20 to 26 g (0.71 to 0.92 oz) and females are only between 16 and 22 grams. During non-breeding seasons, the male plumage is brown, while in breeding season, October to April, they have black plumage with a long tail, approximately 22 cm, and crescent -shaped <span>carotenoid</span> based chest patch. There is significant variation in brightness, hue, and <span>chroma</span> of the carotenoid badges. In contrast, females and subadults, like nonbreeding males, are streaky dull brown with a short tail, approximately 4 cm. Nonbreeding males, however, retain their black tails, while females and subadults' tails are dark-brown.</p>

using('euplectes ardens')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>During prenuptial <span>moulting</span>, prior to the breeding season, the males replace their non-breeding feathers. Males that hold territory have shorter tails and <span>carotenoid</span> collars that are 40% larger than nonbreeding floating males . The red collar is for male-male competition, while female choice is based on tail length. Tail length is negatively correlated with carotenoid signal. Also, looking at body size and condition, this accounts for 55% of the variation in tail length. Body size may play a role in the variation of size and redness of both territorial and floater males. Female preference for long tails was first observed in long-tailed widowbirds, and then subsequently observed in Jackson&#x2019;s widowbird and the red-collared widowbird. Tail length explains 47% of the male&#x2019;s reproductive success, indicating the strength of this sexual ornament. Tail symmetry, however, does not have an effect on mating success. In the red-collared widowbird there is a strong trade-off between carotenoid coloration, which is an agonistic signal and tail length, which is an epigamic signal, directly attracting females. These are both costly ornaments that are maintained through multiple receivers.</p>

using('euplectes ardens')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Fluctuating asymmetry is a population phenomenon of random deviation in a morphological trait. Some researchers think that fluctuating asymmetry reflect an indirect measure of fitness. This is because sexual ornaments are under intense <span>directional selection</span>. The sexual ornament displayed, the degree of fluctuating asymmetry, reflects the male&#x2019;s ability to deal with environmental and genetic stress, thus as an observer, there is a compromise in males between tail length and symmetry. The tail length itself is the strongest predictor of mating success. However, when the tails were experimentally manipulated, comparing a shortened tail to the control, these males had equal success in acquiring territory with no difference in size or quality. The long-tailed controls spent less time flying and performing courtship displays and they attracted higher quality and more nesting females compared to short-tailed males.</p>

using('euplectes ardens')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Demonstrating the high cost of the long tail, the control birds with longer tails showed a more significant decline in condition, measured by relative body mass, compared to the birds with shorter tailed birds. Additionally, longer tails are aerodynamically costly, hindering flying ability by increasing drag. Both the short tailed and control residents have declined condition compared to the floaters, the males who did not establish territories, which suggests an interaction between tail lengths and there is high cost of territory acquisition, defense, and courtship displays.</p>

using('euplectes ardens')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>To explain the existence of multiple handicap signals, multiple receiver hypothesis has been proposed. In an environment, rivals and mates potentially assess different signals, thus making more than one ornament maintain stable condition-dependent signals, reflecting different qualities or associated costs. These signals are maintained because they target different receivers and reflect different aspects of fitness. This is extended to explain increasing complexity of signals, where different receivers are receptive to different aspects of the same signal. In the case of the red-collared widowbird, the elongated tail addresses female choice, while the red carotenoid badge addresses aggressive male competition over territory.</p>

<p>The <b>Long-tailed Widowbird</b> (<i>Euplectes progne</i>), also known as the &#x201C;Sakabula,&#x201D; is a species of bird in the <span>Ploceidae</span> family. The species are found in <span>Angola</span>, <span>Botswana</span>, the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, <span>Kenya</span>, <span>Lesotho</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, <span>Swaziland</span>, <span>Zambia</span>, and southern <span>Zaire</span>. The Long-tailed Widowbird is a medium-sized bird and one of the most common in the territories it inhabits. Adult breeding males are almost entirely black with orange and white shoulders (epaulets), long, wide tails, and a bluish white bill. Females are rather inconspicuous, their feathers streaked tawny and black with pale patches on the chest, breast and back, narrow tail feathers, and horn-color bills.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>When flying, male Long-tailed Widowbirds are readily visible due to their extremely long tails. Between six and eight of their twelve tail feathers are approximately half a metre (approximately 20 inches) long. The tail during flight display is expanded vertically into a deep, long keel below the male as he flies with slow wingbeats 0.5 to 2 metres (20 to 78 inches) above his territory.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Because of the seemingly large cost to such male ornaments, the Long-tailed Widowbird has been the subject of extensive research into the function and evolution of sexually selected traits. This research has demonstrated the existence of female choice in sexual selection and indicates the trade-offs between sexual appeal and physical constraints with regard to the evolution of sexual ornaments.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Long-tailed Widowbird was first described by Pieter Boddaert, a Dutch physician and naturalist, in 1783. The Long-tailed Widowbird is a member of the genus <i><span>Euplectes</span></i>, and therefore closely related to other species of Widowbirds and Bishops. The Long-tailed Widowbird is classified as a <span>passerine</span> bird in the weaver family, <span>Ploceidae</span>, named in 1758 by <span>Carl Linnaeus</span> in 1758. The Long-tailed Widowbird has several of the common morphological traits and dietary preferences of this family, including its rounded conical bill and feeding on seeds.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Long-tailed Widowbird has three geographically differentiated subspecies. These include <i>delamerei</i>, found in the highlands of Kenya, <i>delacouri</i>, found in the Congo, Angola and Zambia, and <i>progne</i>, found in Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland and Lesotho. Some researchers have suggested the existence of Long-tailed Widowbird <span>superspecies</span> based on similarity in male nuptial plumage such as tail length, but this is the topic of some debate.</p>

A range map of the habitat of the long-tailed widowbird</div>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>There are three known isolated populations of Long-tailed Widowbirds. The first is found in the Kenyan highlands, the second in <span>Angola</span>, southern <span>Zaire</span> and <span>Zambia</span>, and the third in Southern Africa. It is unknown when these populations were last in contact, however, the central population differs most in morphology relative to the other two populations. The Southern African population extends from the Eastern Cape Providence through the Free State, Lesotho, Transkei, KwaZulu Natal, and western Swaziland to the Transvaal plateau. The species just enters southeastern <span>Botswana</span>, but is most commonly found in the central highveld of South Africa. The Long-tailed Widowbird can be found at elevations up to 2750 metres (9022 feet) in the Drakensberg Mountains.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Long-tailed Widowbirds are generally found in swampy grassland in <span>flocks</span> consisting of one or two males and a number of females. The males fly with their tails drooping and somewhat spread, and with slow regular movements of their wings. In wet weather, they are unable to fly due to their elongated tails. During the non-breeding season, Long-tailed Widowbirds congregate into flocks, which can be found roosting in reed beds.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Long-tailed Widowbird&#x2019;s diet generally consists of seeds, supplemented occasionally by arthropods. The birds do most of their foraging in flocks on the ground, though they are occasionally observed hawking insects airily. The Long-tailed Widowbird feeds on a distinct variety of seeds, including those of <i><span>Setaria sphacelata</span></i> (Twisted-leaf bristle grass), <i><span>Paspalum dilatatum</span></i> (Common paspalum), <i><span>Paspalum distichum</span></i> (Couch paspalum), <i><span>Pennisetum clandestinum</span></i> (Kikuyu grass), <i><span>Triticum</span></i> (wheat), <i><span>Themeda triandra</span></i> (Rooigras), and <i><span>Senecio juniperinus</span></i> (groundsel). They also feed upon both insects, including species of beetles (<span>Coleoptera</span>), cicadas and aphids (<span>Hemiptera</span>), and <span>spiders</span>.</p>

<p>Non-breeding males are slightly larger than females, though they demonstrate a remarkably similar appearance. For the most part, these males are colored in the same manner as the females, except in that they are more broadly streaked above and below and have wings and wing shoulders with the morphology of the breeding class of males. Rarely, males in the non-breeding class have elongated brownish black tail feathers, though these feathers are substantially shorter than those of the breeding class.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Males defend territories in the <span>grasslands</span> the species inhabits. Females have a long nesting period and survey these territories and the males that inhabit them prior to mate selection. Breeding takes place from February to July, reaching its peak in March and April. Females weave nests, shaped in large dome structures with a lining of seedheads, in the high grass within males&#x2019; territories. The nests are placed 0.5-1 meters (19 to 40 inches) of the ground in the upper third of the high grass (<i>Eleusine jaegeri</i>), where the females raise their two to three young. Females often mate with the male within whose territories they nest. Females lay one to three eggs after mating. These eggs are pale bluish green and streaked with brown. These are usually around 23.5 millimeters (0.9 inches) by 16.5 mm (0.6 inches) in size.</p>

Male Long-tailed Widowbird</div>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The male Long-tailed Widowbird has one of the most remarkable ornaments among <span>passerine</span> birds. Their tails, which are often more than half a meter (20 inches) long, are the most extreme sexual ornament among Euplectes and seem to in fact be detrimental to the survival of the male. Thus, the tail appears to oppose forces of natural selection in the basic sense by decreasing survival in individuals who carry the trait. It was for this reason that researchers have chosen to focus their research into female choice on the confusing example of the Long-tailed Widowbird.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Malte Andersson and colleagues tested Darwin&#x2019;s (and Fisher&#x2019;s) theory of female preference for ornamentation as the cause of extreme elongation of the male Long-tailed Widowbird&#x2019;s tail. They changed the length of males&#x2019; tails and studied their relative mating success. Early in the breeding season, the territories of thirty-six males were mapped and the numbers of nests were counted. The experimenters used each male as his own control by subtracting the number of nests in each male&#x2019;s territory before treatment from the total of nests after treatment. This reduced the influence of initial variation among male territories on the outcome of the experiment. In a randomized block experiment, the color-ringed males were partitioned among nine groups of four males each. These groups were similar in territory quality and tail length. The tail of one randomly selected male within each group was cut to about 14 centimeters (5 inches) in length. Each removed feather was then glued to the corresponding feather of another male, elongating his tail by 20 to 30 centimeters (8 to 12 inches). The two other males in the group served as controls. One had his tail cut and repaired using glue, while the other&#x2019;s tail was left unchanged.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A clear pattern of success emerged, with males with the elongated tails being the most successful, followed by the control (normal tail length) males, followed by the males with shortened tails. The result indicated that the long tail is favored by sexual selection through female choice of mates. Female preference for long tails is also seen in the <span>Red-collared Widowbird</span>.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Andersson experiment demonstrated that female Long-tailed Widowbirds prefer supernormal tails, as males with elongated tails were found to be the most reproductively successful. Amazingly, the tail females found most attractive were longer than those that occur in the natural setting. This outcome was shown to be the result of female choice rather than differences in male behavior resulting from shortened tails: males with shortened tails neither became less active in courtship display, nor did they give up their breeding territories. Thus, the tail is used to attract females rather than in direct contests among males, which is further supported by the fact that males do not expand their tails during flight displays during territorial contests.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>One explanation for why females favor long tails in males is that the expanded tail enlarges the lateral surface area of the male by 2-3 times, making him much more visible from far distances over open grassland. However, this is most likely not the whole explanation, especially considering that prior to mating, females spend a great deal of time comparing males and, thus, do not rely on sighting them from a distance.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>As of this time, the exact function of <span>epaulet</span> in male Long-tailed Widowbirds is unknown. But, its use does resemble that of the <span>Red-Winged Blackbird</span>, being displayed during courtship and threat displays. Thus, the two most conspicuous ornaments of the male birds in the two species may be favored by different forms of sexual selection: the tail of the Long-tailed Widowbird by female choice and the brightly colored epaulets of the Long-tailed Widowbird and Red-winged Blackbird by male contest competition.</p>

using('euplectes progne')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Long-tailed Widowbird has a very large range, and so the species would not be classified as Vulnerable under the range size criterion put forward by Bird Life International which include that the extent of occurrence being less than 20,000 km (7722 miles) combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation. The population is stable according to the population trend criterion, which requires a greater than 30% decline over ten years or three generations, and would not be considered Vulnerable for this reason. While the total population size has not yet been quantified, it is not believed that the Long-tailed Widowbird is approaching the threshold for being considered Vulnerable under the population size criterion (less than 10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be greater than 10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.</p>

<p>The Amur falcon breeds in east Asia from the Transbaikalia, Amurland, and northern Mongolian region to parts of North Korea. They migrate in a broad front through India, sometimes further east over Thailand and Cambodia and then over the Arabian Sea, sometimes in passage on the Maldives and other islands to reach southern Africa. Birds going over India are thought to be aided by strong winds blowing westward. These winds are strong at an altitude of about 3000m and the birds are thought to fly at a height of above 1000m during migration. The route taken to return to their breeding grounds is not clear but they avoid the long ocean crossing and possibly take an overland route northward through Africa and to the west of the Himalayas. Vagrants have been recorded as far west as in Italy, Sweden, St. Helena and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The breeding season is May to June and several pairs may nest close together. Abandoned nest platforms belonging to birds of prey or corvids and even tree hollows are re-used for nesting. Three or four eggs are laid (at two day intervals). Both parents take turns to incubate and feed the chicks which hatch after about a month. The young birds leave the nest after about a month.</p>

using('falco fasciinucha')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This small falcon is fairly distinctive, but may offer some confusion with a few other species. The rufous belly causes resemblance with <span>African Hobby</span>, but important features to look out for are a white throat and the obvious rufous patches on the nape. Also the underwing coverts are uniform rufous whereas in African Hobby has more streaking. The most obvious underwing feature though is the fact that the flight feathers are barred black and white whereas there is much more rufous in the flight feathers of African Hobby. The robust, long-winged Taita Falcons have a short tail. Their flight is fast and somewhat heavy looking, but they are adept at aerial hunting.</p>

using('falco fasciinucha')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Threats to the species come from the use of <span>organochlorine</span> <span>pesticide</span> sprays in northern Zimbabwe which may have reduced numbers there, and pesticide-spraying (e.g. through operations to control <span>Red-billed Quelea</span> and <span>locusts</span>) may pose a threat in other regions. Tourist flights using helicopters and micro-light aircraft seem to have caused major disturbance to birds resident along the <span>Victoria Falls</span> gorges, where the remaining birds are threatened with flooding by a proposed dam. Reasons for its scarcity in East Africa possibly include competition for food and nest sites with the larger and more dominant <span>Peregrine Falcon</span> (<i>Falco peregrinus</i>) and predation of young by the Peregrine Falcon, <span>Lanner Falcon</span> (<i>Falco biarmicus</i>) and owls.</p>

<p><i>Falco peregrinus</i> was first described under its current binomial name by English ornithologist <span>Marmaduke Tunstall</span> in his 1771 work <i>Ornithologia Britannica</i>. The scientific name <i>Falco peregrinus</i> is a <span>Medieval Latin</span> phrase that was used by <span>Albertus Magnus</span> in 1225. The specific name taken from the fact that juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location rather than from the nest, as falcon nests were difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, <i>falco</i>, is related to <i>falx</i>, the Latin word meaning <span>sickle</span>, in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.</p>

<p>The peregrine falcon belongs to a <span>genus</span> whose lineage includes the <span>hierofalcons</span> and the <span>prairie falcon</span> (<i>F. mexicanus</i>).

<p>The <b>Common Kestrel</b> (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>) is a <span>bird of prey</span> <span>species</span> belonging to the <span>kestrel</span> group of the <span>falcon</span> <span>family</span> <span>Falconidae</span>. It is also known as the <b>European Kestrel</b>, <b>Eurasian Kestrel</b>, or <b>Old World Kestrel</b>. In Britain, where no other kestrel species occurs, it is generally just called "the <b>kestrel</b>".</p>

using('falco tinnunculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Common Kestrels measure 32-39 cm (13-15 in) from head to tail, with a wingspan of 65-82 cm (26-32 in). Females are noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing 136-252 g (4.8-8.9 oz), around 155 g (5.5 oz) on average; the adult female weighs 154-314 g (5.4-11.1 oz), around 184 g (6.5 oz) on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most <span>songbirds</span>. Like the other <i><span>Falco</span></i> <span>species</span>, they have long wings as well as a distinctive long tail.</p>

using('falco tinnunculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the cool-<span>temperate</span> parts of its range, the Common Kestrel <span>migrates</span> south in winter; otherwise it is sedentary, though juveniles may wander around in search for a good place to settle down as they become mature. It is a <span>diurnal animal</span> of the lowlands and prefers open <span>habitat</span> such as <span>fields</span>, <span>heaths</span>, <span>shrubland</span> and <span>marshland</span>. It does not require woodland to be present as long as there are alternative perching and nesting sites like rocks or buildings. It will thrive in treeless <span>steppe</span> where there are abundant <span>herbaceous plants</span> and <span>shrubs</span> to support a population of prey animals. The Common Kestrel readily adapts to human settlement, as long as sufficient swathes of vegetation are available, and may even be found in <span>wetlands</span>, <span>moorlands</span> and <span>arid</span> <span>savanna</span>. It is found from the sea to the lower mountain ranges, reaching up to 4,500 m (14,800 ft) <span>ASL</span> in the hottest <span>tropical</span> parts of its range but only to about 1,750 m (5,740 ft) in the <span>subtropical</span> climate of the <span>Himalayan</span> <span>foothills</span></p>

using('falco tinnunculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>When hunting, the Common Kestrel characteristically hovers about 10-20 m (33-66 ft) above the ground, searching for prey, either by flying into the wind or by soaring using <span>ridge lift</span>. Like most <span>birds of prey</span>, Common Kestrels have keen eyesight enabling them to spot small prey from a distance. Once prey is sighted, the bird makes a short, steep dive toward the target. It can often be found hunting along the sides of roads and motorways. This <span>species</span> is able to see <span>near ultraviolet</span> light, allowing the birds to detect the <span>urine</span> trails around <span>rodent</span> burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight. Another favourite (but less conspicuous) hunting technique is to perch a bit above the ground cover, surveying the area. When the birds spot prey animals moving by, they will pounce on them. They also prowl a patch of hunting ground in a ground-hugging flight, ambushing prey as they happen across it.</p>

using('falco tinnunculus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Data from <span>Britain</span> shows nesting pairs bringing up about 2-3 chicks on average, though this includes a considerable rate of total brood failures; actually, few pairs that do manage to fledge offspring raise less than 3 or 4. <span>Population cycles</span> of prey, particularly voles, have a considerable influence on breeding success. Most Common Kestrels die before they reach 2 years of age; mortality til the first birthday may be as high as 70%. At least females generally breed at one year of age; possibly, some males take a year longer to maturity as they do in related species. The biological lifespan to death from <span>senescence</span> can be 16 years or more, however; one was recorded to have lived almost 24 years.</p>

<p>The <b>Red-footed Falcon</b> (<i>Falco vespertinus</i>), formerly <b>Western Red-footed Falcon</b>, is a <span>bird of prey</span>. It belongs to the family <span>Falconidae</span>, the falcons. This <span>bird</span> is found in eastern Europe and Asia although its numbers are dwindling rapidly due to habitat loss and hunting. It is <span>migratory</span>, wintering in <span>Africa</span>. It is a regular wanderer to western Europe, and in August 2004 a Red-footed Falcon was found in <span>North America</span> for the first time on the island of <span>Martha's Vineyard</span>, <span>Massachusetts</span>.</p>

<p><b>Azerbaijan</b> Red-footed falcons were witnessed copulating several times over a week-long period and "showed a strong preference for an old magpie nest"  Frequent copulation was interspersed with joint inspections of the magpie nest. The morning after the aforementioned observations, the pair was again observed and they repeated their behavior. Both then defended against an attack by a Lesser Kestrel. On this day neither bird spent much time in the nest, but always remained perched beside it. At the end of the week the researchers revisited the nest. The behavior this time was that the female sat in the nest and the male perched outside but in the same tree. Further defensive responses to Lesser Kestrels were observed. The male red-footed falcon hunted for large insects and fed them to the female. Copulation then occurred. After copulation, the female returned to sit in the nest until the male fed her again. This behavior continued for several days. This pair clearly showed territorial behavior. The frequent copulations and lengthy stay of the female in the nest suggested incubation but the researchers did not check the nest.</p>

<p>The black-footed cat is one of the smallest cat species. Adult resident males weigh on average 1.9 kg (4.2 lb) and a maximum of 2.45 kg (5.4 lb). Adult resident females weigh on average 1.3 kg (2.9 lb) and a maximum of 1.65 kg (3.6 lb). Males reach a head-to-body length of 36.7 to 43.3 cm (14.4 to 17.0 in) with tails 16.4 to 19.8 cm (6.5 to 7.8 in) long. Females are smaller with a maximum head-to-body-length of 36.9 cm (14.5 in) and taills 12.6 to 17.0 cm (5.0 to 6.7 in) long. The shoulder height is about 25 centimetres (9.8 in).</p>

<p><span>Wuppertal</span> Zoo acquired black-footed cats as long ago as 1957, and succeeded in breeding them in 1963. In 1993, the <span>European Endangered Species Programme</span> was formed to coordinate which animals are best suited for pairing to maintain genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding. The <i>International Studbook</i> for the black-footed cat is kept in the German Wuppertal Zoo. As of July 2011, there are detailed records for a total of 726 captive cats since 1964; worldwide 74 individuals were kept in 23 institutions in Germany, <span>United Arab Emirates</span>, USA, UK, and South Africa.</p>

<p>The wildcat shows a high degree of geographic variation. Asiatic subspecies have spotted, <span>isabelline</span> coats, African subspecies have sandy-grey fur with banded legs and red-backed ears, and European wildcats resemble heavily built striped <span>tabbies</span> with bushy tails, white chins and throats. All subspecies are generally larger than house cats, with longer legs and more robust bodies. The actual number of <span>subspecies</span> is still debated, with some organisations recognising 22, while others recognise only four, including the <span>Chinese mountain cat</span>, which was previously considered a species in its own right.</p>

using('felis silvestris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The wildcat's closest living relatives are the <span>sand cat</span>, the <span>Chinese mountain cat</span> (which may be a subspecies of wildcat), the <span>jungle cat</span> and the <span>black-footed cat</span>. As a whole, the wildcat (along with the jungle and <span>leopard cat</span>) represents a much less <span>specialised</span> form than the sand cat and <span>manul</span>. However, wildcat subspecies of the <i>lybica</i> group do exhibit some further specialisation, namely in the structure of the <span>auditory bullae</span>, which bears similarity to those of the sand cat and manul.</p>

<p>Compared to other members of the <i><span>Felinae</span></i>, the wildcat is a small species, but is nonetheless larger than the <span>housecat</span>. The wildcat is similar in appearance to a striped <span>tabby cat</span>, but has relatively longer legs, a more robust build, and a greater <span>cranial</span> volume. The tail is long, and usually slightly exceeds one-half of the animal's body length. Its skull is more spherical in shape than that of the <span>jungle</span> and <span>leopard cat</span>. The ears are moderate in length, and broad at the base. The eyes are large, with vertical <span>pupils</span>, and yellowish-green <span>irises</span>. Its <span>dentition</span> is relatively smaller and weaker than the jungle cat's. The species size varies according to <span>Bergmann's rule</span>, with the largest specimens occurring in cool, northern areas of Europe (such as <span>Scotland</span> and <span>Scandinavia</span>) and of Middle Asia (such as <span>Mongolia</span>, <span>Manchuria</span> and <span>Siberia</span>). Males measure 43 to 91 cm (17 to 36 in) in body length, 23 to 40 cm (9.1 to 15.7 in) in tail length, and normally weigh 5 to 8 kg (11 to 18 lb). Females are slightly smaller, measuring 40 to 77 cm (16 to 30 in) in body length and 18 to 35 cm (7.1 to 13.8 in) in tail length, and weighing 3 to 5 kg (6.6 to 11.0 lb).</p>

<p>Both sexes possess pre-anal glands, which consist of moderately sized <span>sweat</span> and <span>sebaceous glands</span> around the <span>anal opening</span>. Large-sized sebaceous and <span>scent glands</span> extend along the full length of the tail on the dorsal side. Male wildcats have pre-anal pockets located on the tail, which are activated upon reaching <span>sexual maturity</span>. These pockets play a significant role in reproduction and <span>territorial marking</span>. The species has two thoracic and two abdominal <span>teats</span>. The wildcat has good <span>night vision</span>, having 20 to 100% higher <span>retinal ganglion cell</span> densities than the housecat. It may have <span>colour vision</span> as the densities of its cone receptors are more than 100% higher than in the housecat. Its sense of smell is acute, and it can detect meat at up to 200 metres. The wildcat's <span>whiskers</span> are white; they can reach 5 to 8 cm in length on the lips, and number 7 to 16 on each side. The <span>eyelashes</span> range from 5 to 6 cm in length, and can number 6 to 8 per side. Whiskers are also present on the inner surface of the <span>wrist</span>, and can measure 3 to 4 cm.</p>

<p>The forest wildcat's fur is fairly uniform in length throughout the body. The hair on the tail is very long and dense, thus making it look furry and thick. In winter, the <span>guard hairs</span> measure 7 cm, the tip hairs 5.5-6 cm, and the underfur 4.5-5.5 cm. Corresponding measurements in the summer are 5-6.7 cm, 4.5-6 cm, and 5.3 cm. In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light grey, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating at the base of the tail. Indistinct black smudges are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light grey, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2-3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter grey around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the shoulder region, in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured. The patterns on the head and neck are as well-developed as those on the tail, though the patterns on the flanks are almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>The steppe wildcat's coat is lighter than the forest wildcat's, and never attains the level of density, length, or luxuriance as that of the forest wildcat, even in winter. The tail appears much thinner than that of the forest wildcat, as the hairs there are much shorter, and more close-fitting. The colours and patterns of the steppe wildcat vary greatly, though the general background colour of the skin on the body's upper surface is very lightly coloured. The hairs along the spine are usually darker, forming a dark grey, brownish, or ochreous band. Small and rounded spots cover the entirety of the species' upper body. These spots are solid and sharply defined, and do not occur in clusters or appear in <span>rosette</span> patterns. They usually do not form transverse rows or transverse stripes on the trunk, as is the case in the forest wildcat. Only on the thighs are distinct striping patterns visible. The underside is mainly white, with a light grey, creamy or pale yellow tinge. The spots on the chest and abdomen are much larger and more blurred than on the back. The lower neck, throat, neck, and the region between the forelegs are devoid of spots, or have bear them only distinctly. The tail is mostly the same colour as the back, with the addition of a dark and narrow stripe along the upper two-thirds of the tail. The tip of the tail is black, with 2-5 black transverse rings above it. The upper lips and eyelids are light, pale yellow-white. The facial region is of an intense grey colour, while the top of the head is covered with a dark grey coat. In some specimens, the forehead is covered in dense clusters of brown spots. A narrow, dark brown stripe extends from the corner of the eye to the base of the ear.</p>

using('felis silvestris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The wildcat does not dig its own burrows, instead sheltering in the hollows of old or fallen trees, rock fissures, and the abandoned nests or earths of other animals (heron nests, and abandoned fox or badger earths in Europe, and abandoned <span>fennec</span> dens in Africa). When threatened, a wildcat with a den will retreat into it, rather than climb trees. When taking residence in a tree hollow, the wildcat selects one low to the ground. Dens in rocks or burrows are lined with dry grasses and bird <span>feathers</span>. Dens in tree hollows usually contain enough sawdust to make lining unnecessary. During <span>flea</span> infestations, the wildcat leaves its den in favour of another. During winter, when snowfall prevents the wildcat from travelling long distances, it remains within its den more than usual.</p>

using('felis silvestris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>When hunting, the wildcat patrols forests and along forest boundaries and glades. In favourable conditions, it will readily feed in fields. The wildcat will pursue prey atop trees, even jumping from one branch to another. On the ground, it lies in wait for prey, then catches it by executing a few leaps, which can span three metres. <span>Sight</span> and <span>hearing</span> are the wildcat's primary senses when hunting, its sense of smell being comparatively weak. When hunting aquatic prey, such as <span>ducks</span> or <span>nutrias</span>, the wildcat waits on trees overhanging the water. It kills small prey by grabbing it in its claws, and piercing the neck or <span>occiput</span> with its fangs. When attacking large prey, the wildcat leaps upon the animal's back, and attempts to bite the neck or <span>carotid</span>. It does not persist in attacking if prey manages to escape it. Wildcats hunting <span>rabbits</span> have been observed to wait above rabbit warrens for their prey to emerge. Although primarily a solitary predator, the wildcat has been known to hunt in pairs or in family groups, with each cat devoted entirely to either listening, stalking, and pouncing. While wildcats in Europe will <span>cache</span> their food, such a behaviour has not been observed in their African counterparts.</p>

using('felis silvestris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The diet of wildcats in <span>Great Britain</span> varies geographically; in eastern <span>Scotland</span>, <span>lagomorphs</span> make up 70% of their diet, while in the west, 47% consists of small rodents. In Western Europe, the wildcat feeds on <span>hamsters</span>, <span>brown rats</span>, dormice, <span>water voles</span>, voles, and <span>wood mice</span>. From time to time, small carnivores (<span>martens</span>, <span>polecats</span>, <span>stoats</span>, and <span>weasels</span>) are preyed upon, as well as the fawns of <span>red deer</span>, <span>roe deer</span>, and <span>chamois</span>. In the <span>Carpathians</span>, the wildcat feeds primarily on <span>yellow-necked mice</span>, <span>red-backed voles</span>, and <span>ground voles</span>. <span>European hares</span> are also taken on occasion. In <span>Transcarpathia</span>, the wildcat's diet consists of mouse-like rodents, <span>galliform</span> birds, and <span>squirrels</span>. Wildcats in the <span>Dnestr</span> swamps feed on <span>small voles</span>, water voles, and birds, while those living in the <span>Prut</span> swamps primarily target water voles, brown rats, and <span>muskrats</span>. Birds taken by Prut wildcats include <span>warblers</span>, <span>ferruginous ducks</span>, <span>coots</span>, <span>spotted crakes</span>, and <span>gadwalls</span>. In <span>Moldavia</span>, the wildcat's winter diet consists primarily of rodents, while birds, <span>fish</span>, and <span>crayfish</span> are eaten in summer. Brown rats and water voles, as well as muskrats and <span>waterfowl</span> are the main sources of food for wildcats in the <span>Kuban delta</span>. Wildcats in the northern <span>Caucasus</span> feed on mouse-like rodents and <span>edible dormice</span>, as well as birds on rare occasions. On rare occasions, young chamois and roe deer, are also attacked. Wildcats on the <span>Black Sea</span> coast are thought to feed on small birds, shrews, and hares. On one occasion, the feathers of a <span>white-tailed eagle</span> and the skull of a <span>kid</span> were found at a den site. In <span>Transcaucasia</span>, the wildcat's diet consists of <span>gerbils</span>, voles, birds, and <span>reptiles</span> in the summer, and birds, mouse-like rodents, and hares in winter. <span>Turkmenian</span> wildcats feed on <span>great</span> and red-tailed gerbils, <span>Afghan voles</span>, <span>thin-toed ground squirrels</span>, <span>tolai hares</span>, small birds (particularly <span>larks</span>), <span>lizards</span>, <span>beetles</span>, and <span>grasshoppers</span>. Near <span>Repetek</span>, the wildcat is responsible for destroying over 50% of nests made by <span>desert finches</span>, <span>streaked scrub warblers</span>, red-tailed warblers, and <span>turtledoves</span>. In the <span>Qarshi</span> steppes of <span>Uzbekistan</span>, the wildcat's prey, in descending order of preference, includes great and red-tailed gerbils, <span>jerboas</span>, other rodents and passerine birds, reptiles, and insects. Wilcats in eastern <span>Kyzyl Kum</span> have similar prey preferences, with the addition of tolai hares, <span>midday gerbils</span>, <span>five-toed jerboas</span>, and <span>steppe agamas</span>. In <span>Kyrgyzstan</span>, the wildcat's primary prey varies from tolai hares near <span>Issyk Kul</span>, <span>pheasants</span> in the <span>Chu</span> and <span>Talas</span> valleys, and mouse-like rodents and <span>grey partridges</span> in the foothills. In <span>Kazakhstan</span>'s lower <span>Ili</span>, the wildcat mainly targets rodents, muskrats, and <span>Tamarisk gerbils</span>. Occasionally, remains of young roe deer and <span>wild boar</span> are present in its faeces. After rodents, birds follow in importanance, along with reptiles, fish, insects, eggs, grass stalks and nuts (which probably enter the cat's stomach through pheasant <span>crops</span>). In west <span>Africa</span>, the wildcat feeds on rats, mice, gerbils, hares, small to medium-sized birds (up to <span>francolins</span>), and lizards. In southern Africa, where wildcats attain greater sizes than their western counterparts, <span>antelope</span> fawns and domestic stock, such as <span>lambs</span> and kids are occasionally targeted.</p>

<p>Frigate birds are built for flying; they rarely swim and cannot walk but can manage to climb around the trees and bushes in which they nest. They have a very light skeleton and long narrow wings and are masters of the air. Their name probably derives from the fact that they harass other sea birds such as <span>boobies</span> and <span>tropicbirds</span> as they return to their nests from feeding, forcing them to disgorge their catch, which is then swooped upon and caught by the frigate birds before it reaches the water below. This practice seems to be more common among female frigate birds, but probably only accounts for a fairly small proportion of the diet, which mainly consists of <span>squid</span> and <span>flying fish</span> scooped up from the surface of the sea.</p>

<p>Breeding seems to occur between May and December in the Australian region. They nest in trees (on Christmas Island) and both sexes contribute to nest building and incubation and feeding of the young. One egg is laid which takes 6-7 weeks to hatch. Fledglings are not left alone for another seven weeks or so for fear that they may be attacked and eaten by other birds including other frigate birds. They remain in the nest for another 6 months or so until fledged but they are cared for and fed by their parents for quite a long time after that.</p>

Both parents incubate the egg in shifts that last between 3-6 days; the length of shift varies by location, although female shifts are longer than those of males. Incubation can be energetically demanding, birds have been recorded losing between 20-33% of their body mass during a shift.</p>

<p>Parental care is prolonged in great frigatebirds. <span>Fledging</span> occurs after four to six months, the timing dependent on oceanic conditions and food availability. After fledging chicks continue to receive parental care for between 150-428 days; frigatebirds have the longest period of post-fledging parental care of any bird. The length of this care depends on oceanic conditions, in bad years (particularly <span>El Ni&#xF1;o</span> years) the period of care is longer. The diet of these juvenile birds is provided in part by food they obtained for themselves and in part from their parents. Young <span>fledglings</span> will also engage in <span>play</span>; with one bird picking up a stick and being chased by one or more other fledglings. After the chick drops the stick the chaser attempts to catch the stick before it hits the water, after which the game starts again.

From here, the genus <i><span>Giraffa</span></i> evolved and, around 7 mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African ones survived and radiated into several new species. <i>G. camelopardalis</i> arose around 1 mya in eastern Africa during the <span>Pleistocene</span>. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffe descended from <i><span>G. jumae</span></i>; others find <i><span>G. gracilis</span></i> a more likely candidate. The main driver for the evolution of the giraffes is believed to have been the change from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8 mya.

<p>The coat has dark blotches or patches (which can be orange, <span>chestnut</span>, brown, or nearly black in color) separated by light hair (usually white or <span>cream</span> in color). Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern serves as <span>camouflage</span>, allowing it to blend in the light and shade patterns of savanna woodlands. While adult giraffes standing among trees and bushes are hard to see at even a few metres' distance, when moving about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, they rely on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which appears to be more important for calves. The skin underneath the dark areas may serve as windows for <span>thermoregulation</span>, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands. Each individual giraffe has a unique coat pattern. The skin of a giraffe is mostly gray. It is also thick and allows it to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur may serve as a chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main <span>aromatic</span> chemicals are in the fur, although <span>indole</span> and <span>3-methylindole</span> are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odor than the females, the odor may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-meter (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then straightens its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head. In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short "deep sleep" phases while lying are characterized by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate <span>paradoxical sleep</span>. If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the surface.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in length, accounting for much of the animal's vertical height. The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the <span>cervical vertebrae</span>, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long. They comprise 52-54 percent of the length of the giraffe's <span>vertebral column</span>, compared with the 27-33 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe&#x2019;s closest living relative, the <span>okapi</span>. This elongation largely takes place after birth, as giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a <span>nuchal ligament</span>, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior <span>thoracic vertebrae</span>, giving the animal a hump.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>There are two main hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks. The "competing <span>browsers</span> hypothesis" was originally suggested by <span>Charles Darwin</span> and only challenged recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, such as <span>kudu</span>, <span>steenbok</span> and <span>impala</span>, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to 4.5 m (15 ft) high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can only feed up to about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy. However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers, and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The other main theory, the <span>sexual selection</span> hypothesis, proposes that the long necks evolved as a secondary <span>sexual characteristic</span>, giving males an advantage in "necking" contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and the former do not employ other forms of combat. However, one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In mammals, the left <span>recurrent laryngeal nerve</span> is longer than the right; in the giraffe it is over 30 cm (12 in) longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal; the left nerve is over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) long. Each nerve cell in this path begins in the <span>brainstem</span> and passes down the neck along the <span>vagus nerve</span>, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly 5 m (16 ft) in the largest giraffes. The structure of a giraffe's brain resembles that of domestic cattle. The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of <span>dead space</span>, in spite of its narrow windpipe. These factors increase the resistance to airflow. Nevertheless, the animal can still supply enough oxygen to its tissues.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The <span>circulatory system</span> of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than 11 kg (25 lb) and measures about 60 cm (2 ft) long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5 cm (3.0 in). Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute. In the upper neck, a <span>rete mirabile</span> prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head. The <span>jugular veins</span> also contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the <span>inferior vena cava</span> and <span>right atrium</span> while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure (because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them). To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight; preventing too much blood from pouring into them.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>During the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a <span>ruminant</span>, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores, because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's feces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Although generally quiet and non-vocal, giraffes have been heard to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan and make flute-like sounds, and they communicate over long distances using <span>infrasound</span>.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Mothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together. Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This is known as a "<span>calving pool</span>". Adult males play almost no role in raising the young, although they appear to have friendly interactions. Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will stand over her calf and kick at an approaching predator. Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow. The bond a mother shares with her calf varies, though it can last until her next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or as long as a year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. However, males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.</p>

using('giraffa camelopardalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Giraffes have an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation. However, they can fall prey to <span>lions</span> and are regular prey for them in <span>Kruger National Park</span>. <span>Nile crocodiles</span> can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by <span>leopards</span>, <span>spotted hyenas</span> and <span>wild dogs</span>. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood.</p>

<p>Unlike most vultures, the bearded vulture does not have a bald head. This species is relatively small headed, although its neck is powerful and thick. It has a generally elongated, slender shape, sometimes appearing bulkier due to the often hunched back of these birds. The gait on the ground is waddling and the feet are large and powerful. The adult is mostly dark gray, rusty and whitish in color. It is grey-blue to grey-black above. The creamy-coloured forehead contrasts against a black band across the eyes and lores and bristles under the chin, which form a black beard that give the species its English name. Bearded vultures are variably orange or rust on their head, breast and leg feathers but this is actually cosmetic. This colouration may come from dust-bathing, rubbing mud on its body or from drinking in mineral-rich waters. The tail feathers and wings are gray. The juvenile bird is dark black-brown over most of the body, with a buff-brown breast and takes five years to reach full maturity. The lammergeier is silent, apart from shrill whistles in their breeding displays and a falcon-like <i>cheek-acheek</i> call made around the nest.</p>

using('gypaetus barbatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Live prey is sometimes attacked by the bearded vulture, with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture. Among these, <span>tortoises</span> seem to be especially favored depending on their local abundance. Tortoises predated may be nearly as heavy as the predating vulture. When killing tortoise, bearded vultures also fly to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles' hard shells. Golden eagles have been observed to kill tortoises in the same way. Other live animals, up to nearly their own size, been observed to be predaceously seized and dropped in flight. Among these are <span>rock hyraxes</span>, <span>hares</span>, <span>marmots</span> and, in one case, a 62 cm (24 in) long <span>monitor lizard</span>. Larger animals have been known to be attacked by bearded vultures, including <span>ibex</span>, <span>Capra goats</span>, <span>Chamois</span> and <span>Steenbok</span>. These animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths, although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other. Many large animals killed by bearded vultures are unsteady young, have appeared sickly or are obviously injured. Humans have been anecdotally reported to have been killed in the same way. However, this is unconfirmed and, if it does happen, most biologists who have studied the birds generally agreed it would be accidental on the part of the vulture. Occasionally smaller ground-dwelling birds, such as <span>partridges</span> and <span>pigeons</span>, have been reported eaten, possibly either as fresh carrion (which is usually ignored by these birds) or killed with beating wings by the vulture. While foraging for bones or live prey while in flight, bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground, staying around 2 to 4 m (6.6 to 13.1 ft) high. Occasionally, breeding pairs may forage and hunt together. In the <span>Ethiopian Highlands</span>, bearded vultures have adapted to living largely off human refuse.</p>

<p>The <i>Heterohyrax</i> is a bush hyrax, as opposed to a <span>rock hyrax</span> (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) or a <span>tree hyrax</span> (<i>Dendrohyrax</i>). The bush hyrax is distinguishable from the rock hyrax as the bush hyrax is less heavily built and has a narrower muzzle than the rock hyrax. Hyraxes have molariform teeth that are <span>brachydont</span>, meaning they have short crowns and well developed roots. The hyraxes vary in that the bush hyrax has an upper premolar series that is the same length as the molar series, while the rock hyrax has a shorter upper premolar series and the tree hyrax has a longer upper premolar series. Hyraxes also have upper incisors that appear tusk-like and four lower incisors that are comb-like and used to groom the fur. While the incisors do not differentiate between the hyraxes, they do differ between sexes. Males have rigid upper incisors, while the females have rounded upper incisors. Furthermore, the male sex organs also differ greatly between these three genera of hyraxes which inhibits them from interbreeding.</p>

<p>The name giving feature of the yellow-spotted rock hyrax is a dorsal gland that is located on the lower back beneath a raised skin patch about 1.5 cm long and is surrounded by erectile hairs. However, not all <i>Heterohyrax</i> species have a dorsal gland. The secretions of the gland stain a dorsal spot of reddish-<span>ochre</span> to a dirty white coloration, but most commonly appears yellow. The gland is associated with sexual arousal and also plays a role in maternal recognition by young. The bush hyrax is also noted to have a white patch of hair above the eyes where glandular tissue also occurs. Glandular tissue also occurs under the chin and in the genital area.</p>

<p>A study conducted in Zimbabwe showed weights to range from 2.3 kg to 3.6 kg, while another study conducted in the <span>Serengeti National Park</span>, Tanzania found weights to be slightly lower at 1.3 kg to 2.4 kg. Males and females on average do not vary in size, but sometimes the females will be slightly larger than the males. They have short legs, a rudimentary tail and round ears. Their lateral and dorsal coloration tends to be grey among colonies found in <span>arid</span> regions and a dark reddish-brown among those found in more <span>mesic</span> regions. Their pelts are thick and course with guard hairs measuring up to 30 mm. Additionally they have <span>vibrissae</span> that provide tactile feedback located above the eyes, under the chin, along the back and sides, on the abdomen and on the fore- and hind limbs. These vibrissae, or whiskers, measure 90 mm long on the snout, and 70 mm elsewhere.</p>

<p>They bush hyrax also has specialized glands on the pads of their feet that increase their grip which helps them navigate slick rock surfaces. The pads of their feet are flat and naked while secretions from these glands keep the pads moist. The muscles in the feet contract the foot into a cup-like shape, thus resulting in a suction cup-like effect. Hyraxes are known to be excellent climbers due to this specialization and it has even been observed that if shot, they will remain perpendicular on the rock surface as if stuck to the surface. The forepaw has three well-developed digits, a rudimentary thumb, and a small fifth digit. Their digits have flat, hoof-like nails, except for the second digit, which has long, curved claw that is used for grooming. The hind paw is similar except lacking a big toe and the fifth digit is rudimentary.</p>

<p>Genetic variation is minimal within <i>Heterohyrax brucei</i>, the type specie for the bush hyrax.

<p>The hippopotamus is the <span>type genus</span> of the family <span>Hippopotamidae</span>. The <span>pygmy hippopotamus</span> belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either <i><span>Choeropsis</span></i> or <i><span>Hexaprotodon</span>.</i> Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group hippopotamuses and <span>anthracotheres</span> in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other <span>even-toed ungulates</span> in the <span>order</span> <span>Artiodactyla</span>. Other artiodactyls include <span>camels</span>, <span>cattle</span>, <span>deer</span> and <span>pigs</span>, although hippopotamuses are not closely related to these groups.</p>

using('hippopotamus amphibius')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Hippopotamuses are among the largest living land mammals, being only smaller than <span>elephants</span> and some <span>rhinoceroses</span>. Mean adult weight is around 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) and 1,300 kg (2,900 lb) for males and females respectively, very large males can reach 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and an exceptional male weighting almost 2,700 kg (6,000 lb) has been reported. Male hippos appear to continue growing throughout their lives while females reach maximum weight at around age 25. Different from all other large land mammals, hippos are of semiaquatic habits, spending the day in lakes and rivers. The eyes, ears, and nostrils of hippos are placed high on the roof of their skulls. This allows these organs to remain above the surface while the rest of the body submerges. Their barrel-shaped bodies have <span>graviportal</span> skeletal structures, adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their <span>specific gravity</span> allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river. Hippopotamuses have small legs (relative to other <span>megafauna</span>) because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotamuses can gallop at 30 km/h (19 mph) on land but normally trot. They are incapable of jumping but do climb up steep banks. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom. The testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. In addition, the penis retracts into the body when not <span>erect</span>. The genitals of the female are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large <span>diverticula</span> protrude from the <span>vulval vestibule</span>. The function of these is unknown.</p>

using('hippopotamus amphibius')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Unlike most other semiaquatic animals, the hippopotamus has very little hair. The skin is 15 cm (6 in) thick, providing it great protection against <span>conspecifics</span> and predators. By contrast, its <span>subcutaneous fat</span> layer is thin. The animals' upper parts are purplish-gray to blue-black, while the under parts and areas around the eyes and ears can be brownish-pink. Their skin secretes a natural <span>sunscreen</span> substance which is red-colored. The secretion is sometimes referred to as "blood sweat", but is neither blood nor sweat. This secretion is initially colorless and turns red-orange within minutes, eventually becoming brown. Two distinct <span>pigments</span> have been identified in the secretions, one red (<span>hipposudoric acid</span>) and one orange (norhipposudoric acid). The two pigments are highly <span>acidic</span> compounds. Both pigments inhibit the growth of disease-causing <span>bacteria</span>; as well, the <span>light absorption</span> of both pigments peaks in the <span>ultraviolet</span> range, creating a sunscreen effect. All hippos, even those with different diets, secrete the pigments, so it does not appear that food is the source of the pigments. Instead, the animals may synthesize the pigments from <span>precursors</span> such as the <span>amino acid</span> <span>tyrosine</span>. Nevertheless, this natural sunscreen cannot prevent the animal's skin from cracking if it stays out of water too long.</p>

<p>Hippo defecation creates <span>allochthonous</span> deposits of organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can have a significant impact on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.</p>

<p>Hippopotamuses are territorial only in water, where a bull presides over a small stretch of river, on average 250 m (270 yd) in length, and containing 10 females. The largest pods can contain over 100 hippos. Other bachelors are allowed in a bull's stretch, as long as they behave submissively toward the bull. The territories of hippos exist to establish mating rights. Within the pods, the hippos tend to segregate by gender. Bachelors lounge near other bachelors, females with other females, and the bull on his own. When hippos emerge from the water to graze, they do so individually.</p>

In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool.

Adult bluebuck probably rarely exceeded 160 kg (350 lb). None of the four museum specimens shows any sheen of blue. The dark skin showing through the thinning fur of older animals may have caused the blue colours described by several authors or the mix of black and yellow hairs.</p>

<p>Like most antelopes, the bluebuck had six teeth along the cheek in each half of the upper and lower jaws. These formed two distinct series, three premolars immediately followed by three molars. Its remains can be distinguished from those of the roan by smaller molars and premolars, and from the sable by larger premolars, and a higher ratio of premolar row length to molar row length.</p>

<p>It had a relatively long, strong neck with a very short, underdeveloped mane, long white legs with dark bands on the anterior, and a long tail, up to the hock, with a dark, horse-like whisk. It had a long muzzle. Its ears were long and <span>donkey</span>-like, rufous and narrow-pointed, without the black tufts of hair found in the roan.</p>

<p>The long, scimitar-shaped horns inserted directly above the orbits, extending upwards at almost right angles to the skull, and then curving back gently, without any torsion, towards the shoulders. These horns were heavily ridged, with 20-35 rings up to the tip of the horn, comparable to the roan (20-50 rings). Its horns were more lightly built than those of the roan and sable, though, and slightly transversely compressed to the inside. The back-curved horns reminded <span>Jan van Riebeeck</span> of the European <span>ibex</span>, and he called it the <i>steinbok</i>. It remains uncertain how long this name was used, or when it was changed to <i>blaauwbok</i> or bluebuck.</p>

<p>Like the roan and sable, it had to drink daily. Many other antelopes can obtain the moisture they need from the plants they eat and can go for long periods without drinking.</p>

<p>The bluebuck was a selective grazer of medium to long (0.5- to 1.5-m), perennial tuft grasses, such as high-quality red grass (<i>Themeda triandra</i>), spear grass (<i>Heteropogon contortus</i>), buffalo grass (<i>Panicum</i> spp.) and love grass (<i>Eragrostis</i> spp.). Unlike most other antelope, it was not particularly attracted to fresh grass, except during the dry season, when it would graze for short periods along drainage lines and on floodplains on the fresh growth following the yearly fires. However, like most grazers, it would probably browse during the dry season.</p>

<p>Because they had long, dangerous horns, cows tended to be more aggressive than those antelopes whose females are hornless. <span>Dominance</span> hierarchies based on age and individual prowess were vigorously maintained by both sexes. Maternal herds, composed of animals with the same home range, were closed to outsiders. Herd members kept out of range of each other's horns, by increasing the individual space between them.</p>

<p>Bulls were accepted in the natal herd up to the age of 15-18 months, which was unusually long. Until then, their similarity to cows suppressed the <span>aggression</span> of the territorial bulls. <span>Subadult</span> bulls were driven from the herd, and if they did not escape quickly enough, they were killed. They then joined bachelor herds, where they stayed until they reached five or six years of age, when they would be strong enough to defend their own territories.</p>

<p>The sable antelope is <span>sexually dimorphic</span>, with the male heavier and about one-fifth taller than the female. The head-and-body length is typically between 190-255 cm (75-100 in). Males reach about 117-140 cm (46-55 in) at the shoulder, while females are slightly shorter. Males typically weigh 235 kg (518 lb) and females 220 kg (490 lb).

<p>The sable antelope has a compact and robust build, characterised by a thick neck and tough skin. It has a well-developed and often upright mane on its neck as well as a short mane on the throat. Their general colouration is rich chestnut to black. Females and juveniles are chestnut to dark brown, while males begin darkening and turn black after three years. However, in southern populations, females have a brown to black coat. Calves below two months are a light tan and show faint markings. The underparts, cheek, and chin are all white, creating a great contrast with the dark back and flanks. Long, white hairs are present below the eyes, and a wide, black stripe runs over the nose.</p>

The upper wings, underwing flight feathers and forked tail are blackish-blue, but the undertail has white patches near the feather tips. The white throat and blackish breast band are distinctions from similar <i><span>Hirundo</span></i> species. The outer feathers are slightly longer in the male than the female.

<p>This species is a small swallow at 18-25 cm. The adult birds have a highly lustrous dark metallic steel-blue appearance with long tail streamers, which are particularly noticeable in males. White feathers are visible on the rump and flanks when the birds are preening and especially during courtship. In poor light, blue swallows appear almost black and therefore can be mistaken for <span>black saw-wing swallows</span> (<i>Psalidoprocne spp.</i>) which occur throughout its breeding range.

<p>The adult male barn swallow of the nominate subspecies <i>H. r. rustica</i> is 17-19 cm (6.7-7.5 in) long including 2-7 cm (0.79-2.76 in) of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of 32-34.5 cm (12.6-13.6 in) and weighs 16-22 g (0.56-0.78 oz). It has steel blue upperparts and a <span>rufous</span> forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked "swallow tail". There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail. The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts paler. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.</p>

<p>Migration of barn swallows between Britain and South Africa was first established on 23 December 1912 when a bird that had been ringed by James Masefield at a nest in Staffordshire, was found in Natal. As would be expected for a long-distance migrant, this bird has occurred as a vagrant to such distant areas as Hawaii, <span>Bermuda</span>, Greenland, <span>Tristan da Cunha</span> and the <span>Falkland Islands</span>.</p>

<p>The male barn swallow returns to the breeding grounds before the females and selects a nest site, which is then advertised to females with a circling flight and song. The breeding success of the male is related to the length of the tail streamers, with longer streamers being more attractive to the female. Males with longer tail feathers are generally longer-lived and more disease resistant, females thus gaining an indirect fitness benefit from this form of selection, since longer tail feathers indicate a genetically stronger individual which will produce offspring with enhanced vitality. Males in northern Europe have longer tails than those further south; whereas in Spain the male's tail streamers are only 5% longer than the female's, in Finland the difference is 20%. In Denmark, the average male tail length increased by 9% between 1984 and 2004, but it is possible that climatic changes may lead in the future to shorter tails if summers become hot and dry.</p>

using('hirundo rustica')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Males with long streamers also have larger white tail spots, and since feather-eating <span>bird lice</span> prefer white feathers, large white tail spots without <span>parasite</span> damage again demonstrate breeding quality; there is a positive association between spot size and the number of offspring produced each season.</p>

<p><span>Gilbert White</span> studied the barn swallow in detail in his pioneering work <i>The Natural History of Selborne</i>, but even this careful observer was uncertain whether it migrated or hibernated in winter. Elsewhere, its long journeys have been well observed, and a <span>swallow tattoo</span> is popular amongst nautical men as a symbol of a safe return; the tradition was that a mariner had a tattoo of this fellow wanderer after sailing 5,000 nmi (9,300 km; 5,800 mi). A second swallow would be added after 10,000 nmi (19,000 km; 12,000 mi) at sea. In the past, the tolerance for this beneficial <span>insectivore</span> was reinforced by superstitions regarding damage to the barn swallow's nest. Such an act might lead to cows giving bloody milk, or no milk at all, or to hens ceasing to lay. This may be a factor in the longevity of swallows' nests. Survival, with suitable annual refurbishment, for 10-15 years is regular, and one nest was reported to have been occupied for 48 years.</p>

<p>This species gets its name from the very long filamentous outermost tail feathers, which trail behind like two wires. Sexes manifest similar appearances, but the female has shorter "wires".

<p>Brown hyenas can measure 86 to 140 cm (34 to 55 in) in head-and-body length, although they average 110 to 125 cm (43 to 49 in). The height at the shoulder is 70 to 80 cm (28 to 31 in) and the tail is 25 to 35 cm (9.8 to 13.8 in) long. Unlike the larger <span>spotted hyena</span>, there are no sizable differences between the sexes, though males may be slightly larger than the females. The average adult male weighs 40.2 to 43.7 kg (89 to 96 lb), while the average female weighs 37.7 to 40.2 kg (83 to 89 lb). The normal upper weight limit for the species is 55 kg (121 lb), although an occasional outsized specimen can weigh up to 67.6 to 72.6 kg (149 to 160 lb). The coat is long and shaggy, particularly on the tail and back. The general fur color is dark brown, while the head is gray, the upper body tawny and the legs grey with dark horizontal stripes. Erectile hairs 305 mm (12 in) in length cover the neck and back. Brown hyenas have powerful jaws: young animals can crack the leg bones of <span>springboks</span> within five minutes of birth, though this ability deteriorates with age as their teeth gradually wear. The skulls of brown hyenas are larger than those of the more northern <span>striped hyenas</span>, and their dentition is more robust, indicating less generalised dietary adaptations. Brown hyenas possess an anal gland below the base of the tail, which produces <span>a black and white paste</span>. The gland has a groove, coated with a white secretion, which divides a pair of lobes which produce a black secretion. These secretions are deposited on grass stalks roughly every quarter mile of their feeding grounds, particularly around territorial borders.</p>

<p>The striped hyena has a fairly massive, but short <span>torso</span> set on long legs. The hind legs are significantly shorter than the forelimbs, thus causing the back to slope downwards. The legs are relatively thin and weak, with the forelegs being bent at the <span>carpal</span> region. The neck is thick, long and largely immobile, while the head is heavy and massive with a shortened facial region. The eyes are small, while the sharply pointed ears are very large, broad and set high on the head. Like all hyenas, the striped hyena has bulky pads on its paws, as well as blunt but powerful claws. The tail is short and the <span>terminal hairs</span> do not descend below the <span>calcaneal tendon</span>. The striped hyena lacks the enlarged clitoris and false scrotal sack noted in the female <span>genitalia of the spotted hyena</span>. The female has 3 pairs of <span>teats</span>. Adult weight can range from 22 to 55 kg (49 to 121 lb), averaging at about 35 kg (77 lb). Body length can range from 85 to 130 cm (33 to 51 in), not counting a tail of 25 to 40 cm (9.8 to 15.7 in), and shoulder height is between 60-80 cm (24-31 in). The male has a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands open into it from above the <span>anus</span>. Several <span>sebaceous glands</span> are present between the openings of the anal glands and above them. The anus can be everted up to a length of 5 cm, and is everted during social interaction and mating. When attacked, the striped hyena everts its rectum and sprays a pungent smelling liquid from its anal glands. Its <span>eyesight</span> is acute, though its senses of <span>smell</span> and <span>hearing</span> are weak.</p>

<p>The winter coat is unusually long and uniform for an animal its size, with a luxuriant mane of tough, long hairs along the back from the <span>occiput</span> to the base of the tail. The coat is generally coarse and bristly, though this varies according to season. In winter, the coat is fairly dense, soft, and has well-developed underfur. The <span>guard hairs</span> are 50-75 mm long on the flanks, 150-225 mm long on the mane and 150 mm on the tail.

<p>The striped hyena is primarily a scavenger which feeds mainly on <span>ungulate</span> carcasses in different stages of <span>decomposition</span>, fresh bones, <span>cartilages</span>, <span>ligaments</span> and <span>bone marrow</span>. It crushes long bones into fine particles and swallows them, though sometimes entire bones are eaten whole. The striped hyena is not a fussy eater, though it has an aversion to <span>vulture</span> flesh. It will occasionally attack and kill any animal it can overcome. It hunts prey by running it down, grabbing its flanks or groin and inflicting mortal wounds by tearing out the <span>viscera</span>. In Turkmenistan, the species is recorded to feed on <span>wild boar</span>, <span>kulan</span>, <span>porcupines</span> and <span>tortoises</span>. A seasonal abundance of <span>oil willow fruits</span> is an important food source in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, while in the Caucasuses, it is <span>grasshoppers</span>. In Israel, the striped hyena feeds on garbage, carrion and fruits. In eastern Jordan, its main sources of food are feral horse and water buffalo carcasses and village refuse. It has been suggested that only the large hyenas of the Middle East, Asia minor, central Asia and the Indian subcontinent attack large prey, with no evidence of their smaller Arabian and east African cousins doing so. Because of its scavenging diet, the striped hyena requires more water to survive than most other carnivores. When eating, the striped hyena gorges itself until satisfied, though hyenas with cubs will transport food to their dens. Because of the high content of <span>calcium</span> in its diet, the <span>faeces</span> of the striped hyena becomes white very rapidly, and can be visible from long distances.</p>

<p>Striped hyenas were hunted by Ancient Egyptian peasants for duty and amusement along with other animals that were a threat to crops and livestock. <span>Algerian</span> hunters historically considered the killing of striped hyenas as beneath their dignity, due to the animal's reputation for cowardice. A similar attitude was held by British sportsmen in <span>British India</span>. Although striped hyenas are capable of quickly killing a dog with a single bite, they usually <span>feign death</span> when escape from hunting dogs is impossible, and will remain in this state for long periods, even when badly bitten. On some rare occasions, hyenas were ridden down and speared by men on horseback. Although hyenas were generally not fast enough to outrun horses, they had the habit of doubling and turning frequently during chases, thus ensuring long pursuits. Generally though, hyenas were hunted more as pests than sporting quarries; their scavenging damages skulls, skins and other articles from hunter's camps, which made them unpopular among sportsmen. In the <span>Soviet Union</span>, hyena hunting was not specially organised. Most hyenas were caught incidentally in traps meant for other animals. Some hunters in southern <span>Punjab</span>, <span>Kandahar</span> and <span>Quetta</span>, catch striped hyenas to use them in <span>hyena-baiting</span>. The hyenas are pitted against specially trained dogs, and are restrained with ropes in order to pull them away from the dogs if necessary. In Kandahar, hunters locally called <i>payloch</i> (naked foot) hunt striped hyenas by entering their dens naked with a noose in hand. When the hyena is cornered at the end of its lair, the hunter murmurs the magic formula &#x201C;turn into dust, turn into stone,&#x201D; which causes the animal to enter a hypnotic state of total submission, by which point the hunter can slip a noose over its forelegs and, finally, drag it out of the cave. A similar method was once practised by <span>Mesopotamian</span> <span>Arab</span> hunters, who would enter hyena dens and "flatter" the animal, which they believed could understand <span>Arabic</span>. The hunter would murmur "You are very nice and pretty and quite like a lion ; indeed, you are a lion". The hyena would then allow the hunter to place a noose around its neck and pose no resistance on being dragged out of its lair.</p>

<p>The storm petrel is a small bird, 14-18 cm (5.5-7 in) in length with a 36-39 cm (14-15 in) wingspan. It weighs 20-38 g (0.7-1.3 oz), with an average of 28 g (1 oz). It is square-tailed and has all-black <span>plumage</span> except for a snow-white rump that extends to the sides of the tail base and a broad white band on the underwings. Juveniles in fresh plumage can also show a narrow white bar on the upperwing. The plumage becomes dark brown rather than black as it becomes worn. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although in the Mediterranean subspecies, at least, most captured birds can be sexed using a formula which involves multiplying the wing length by the length of the white rump band; females are slightly larger and have a longer white rump than males. The Mediterranean subspecies has longer wings and a heavier bill on average than the nominate form, but neither sex nor subspecies can be determined by observation at sea.</p>

<p>The <span>clutch</span> is a single egg, usually pure white, sometimes with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is 28 x 21 mm (1.1 x 0.82 in), and it weighs 6.8 g (0.24 oz), of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are <span>incubated</span> by both parents for 38-50 days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three days at a time on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are <span>altricial</span> and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50 days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks <span>fledge</span> about 56-86 days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.</p>

<p>The typical prey consists of surface organisms such as small fish, <span>squid</span>, <span>crustaceans</span> and <span>jellyfish</span>. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, more than half the food items are <span>zooplankton</span> and the fish caught include small <span>herring</span> and <span>sprats</span>; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to <span>carotenoids</span>. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in <span>vitamin A</span>, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly <span>Mediterranean sand eels</span>. Petrels also catch <span>opossum shrimps</span> from waters close to the colony. <span>Bluefin tuna</span> farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including <span>angiosperm</span> seeds and <span>sorrel</span>, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.</p>

<p>Storm petrels seem to be largely free of <span>blood parasites</span>, even when in close proximity to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that seabird species with long incubation periods and long lives have well-developed immune systems that prevent serious blood parasitism.</p>

<p>Cape porcupines are the largest rodents in southern Africa and also the world's largest porcupines. They are similar in appearance to, and only slightly larger than, their close relatives, the <span>crested porcupines</span>, and can most easily be distinguished from them by the presence of a band of short white spines along the midline of the rump. Cape porcupines measure 63 to 81 centimetres (25 to 32 inches) long from the head to the base of the tail, with the tail adding a further 11-20 centimetres (4.3-7.9 inches). They weigh from 10 to 24 kilograms (22 to 53 pounds), with exceptionally large specimens weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb); males and females are not significantly different in size.</p>

using('hystrix africaeaustralis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>They are heavily built animals, with stocky bodies, short limbs, and an inconspicuous tail. The body is covered in long spines up to 5 centimetres (2.0 in) in length, interspersed with thicker, sharply pointed, defence quills up to 3 centimetres (1.2 in) long, and with bristly, blackish or brownish fur. The spines on the tail are hollow, and used to make a rattling sound to scare away <span>predators</span>. An erectile crest of long, bristly hairs runs from the top of the head down to the shoulders. The spines and quills cover the back and flanks of the animal, starting about a third of the way down the body, and continuing onto the tail. The quills have multiple bands of black and white along their length, and grow from regularly spaced grooves along the animal's body; each groove holding five to eight quills. The remainder of the animal, including the undersides, is covered with dark hair.</p>

using('hystrix africaeaustralis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Cape porcupines eat mostly plant material: fruits, roots, tubers, bulbs, and bark. They have a long <span>small intestine</span> and large <span>caecum</span>, employing <span>hindgut fermentation</span> to break down the tough materials in their food. They have also been reported to gnaw on carrion and bones. They are often considered pests by local farmers, because they can feed on crops and damage trees. However, this de-barking of trees may also play a role in the maintenance of local savannah ecosystems, helping to prevent the development of denser forested environments.</p>

using('hystrix cristata')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p><i>Hystrix cristata</i> is part of the family Hystricidae. The more common name for this species is the crested porcupine. The adult crested porcupine has an average head and body length of about 60 to 83 cm (24 to 33 in) long, discounting the tail, and weighs from 13 to 27 kg (29 to 60 lb).</p>

using('hystrix cristata')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Almost the entire body is covered with bristles which are either dark brown or black and rather coarse. This <span>mammal</span> is recognizable by the <span>quills</span> that run along the head, nape, and back that can be raised into a crest. Hence the name crested porcupine. There are also some sturdier quills which are about 35 cm (14 in) in length and run along the sides and back half of the body. These sturdier quills are used, for the most part, for defense and are usually marked with light and dark bands which alternate; these are not firmly attached. This porcupine has a shorter tail which has rattle quills at the end. The rattle quills broaden at the terminal end and the broad portion is hollow with thin walls. When these quills are vibrated they produce a hiss-like rattle.</p>

using('hystrix cristata')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The front feet of the crested porcupine have four developed and <span>clawed</span> digits with a regressed thumb, the rear feet have five. The paws have naked and padded soles and have a plantigrade gait. The ears are external and both the eyes and ears are very small with long <span>vibrissae</span> on its head. The skull is specific in many ways, first the <span>infraorbital foramen</span> is greatly enlarged so that portions of the <span>masseter</span> extend through it and attach from the frontal side surface of the snout. Second the angular process is inflected on the lower <span>jaw</span>, thirdly the nasal cavity is enlarged. Prominent pockets create enlarged areas of attachment for chewing <span>muscles</span>. <span>Collar bones</span> are very much reduced, and there are one <span>incisor</span>, one <span>premolar</span> and three <span>molars</span>.</p>

using('hystrix cristata')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The crested porcupine is for the most part <span>herbivorous</span>, eating roots, bulbs, crops. But occasionally they do consume insects, small vertebrates and carrion. In order to ingest <span>calcium</span> and sharpen incisors they often gnaw on bones. These animals often travel long distances looking for food. They have high crowned teeth that grind plant cells which are digested in the <span>stomach</span> and the undigested fibers are retained in an enlarged <span>appendix</span> and anterior large <span>intestine</span> where they are broken down by microorganisms.</p>

<p>The crested porcupine is a terrestrial mammal; they very seldom climb trees, but can swim. They are <span>nocturnal</span> and <span>monogamous</span>. The crested porcupine takes care of the young for a long time and small family groups consist of the adult pair and young of various ages. In defense, when disturbed, they raise and fan their quills to make themselves look bigger. If continually bothered, the crested porcupine will stamp its feet, whirr the quills, and charge the disturber back end first trying to stab the enemy with the thicker, shorter quills. These attacks are known to have killed lions, leopards, hyenas, and even humans.</p>

<p>To achieve <span>gliding flight</span>, it uses two membranes (<span>patagia</span>) which fold up when not in use.

Being <span>arboreal</span>, <i>Idiurus</i> spends all of its time in the trees, living in hollow trunks in groups of 2 to 40.  Limit information suggests that it is mainly <span>frugivorous</span>. It has a long tail in proportion to its body, sporting two lines of raised scales, and patches of scaly skin to help it grip trees, but the rest of its body is furry. The tail is longer than the body and is also used to balance, like a <span>primate</span>'s tail. Long-eared scaly-tailed flying squirrels are about 20cm long and weigh 30g.

<p>The <b>tropical bottlenose whale</b> (<i>Indopacetus pacificus</i>), also known as the <b>Indo-Pacific beaked whale</b> and the <b>Longman's beaked whale</b>, was considered to be the world's rarest <span>cetacean</span> until recently, but the <span>spade-toothed whale</span> now holds that position. As of 2010, the species is now known from nearly a dozen strandings and over 65 sightings.</p>

using('indopacetus pacificus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The species has had a long history riddled with misidentifications, which are now mostly resolved. A skull and jaw found on a beach in <span>Mackay</span>, <span>Queensland</span>, <span>Australia</span> in 1882 provided the initial description by H. A. Longman in 1926, but some authorities insisted on classifying it as a <span>True's beaked whale</span> or a female <span>bottlenose whale</span> instead of a new species. A whale washed up near Danane, <span>Somalia</span> in 1955 was processed into fertilizer with only the skull remaining, and biologist Joseph C. Moore used it to effectively demonstrate it was a unique species. However, there was a considerable debate as to whether the whale belonged in the genus <i>Mesoplodon</i> or not.</p>

using('indopacetus pacificus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Longman's beaked whales look rather similar to both <span>mesoplodont</span> <span>beaked whales</span> and bottlenose whales, which led to a great deal of taxonomic confusion. The Maldives female had a robust body like the bottlenoses, although this may be a distortion, since the less-decomposed female specimen from Japan had a laterally compressed body typical of <i><span>Mesoplodon</span></i>. The juvenile specimens have a very short beak similar to a bottlenose whale, but the adult females seen so far have had rather long beaks sloping gently into a barely noticeable melon organ. Additionally, the dorsal fins of adult specimens seem unusually large and triangular for beaked whales, whereas in juveniles they are rather small and swept back.</p>

using('indopacetus pacificus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>An adult male specimen has yet to wash up, but sightings of the tropical bottlenose whale indicate they have a rather bulbous melon, two teeth located towards the front of the beak, and scars from fighting with the teeth. Scars from <span>cookiecutter sharks</span> are also rather common on the whale. The rather unusual coloration of the juveniles helped connect the Longman's to the tropical bottlenose whale; both have dark backs behind the blowholes, which quickly shade down to a light gray and then white. The blackness from the back extends down to the eye of the whale except for a light spot behind the eye, and then continues on in a line towards the flipper, which is also dark.</p>

using('indopacetus pacificus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Dark markings are also present on the tip of the beak and rostrum. The females have a simpler coloration; the body is typically grayish except for a brown head. The coloration appears to be rather variable in this species. The female specimen from the Maldives was six metres (20 feet) in length, with a one-metre (3 foot) fetus, and the Japanese female was 6.5 metres (22 feet) in length. Reports of tropical beaked whales put them even longer, in the 7-8 metre (23-26 foot) range, which is larger than any mesoplodont and more typical of a bottlenose whale. No weight estimation or reproductive information is known.</p>

using('indopacetus pacificus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Range of Longman's beaked whales were once considered to be restricted to warmer waters of Pacific, but stranding records in recent years revealed they may migrate further north to sub-Arctic regions such as off <span>Hokkaido</span>. There have not been any of occurrence confirmed in <span>Sea of Japan</span>, but a possible Longman's beaked stranded on a beach near <span>Vladivostok</span> in 2011.</p>

<p>It nests along the margins of flood plains, usually when the water inundates the forests. It appears to prefer thicket vegetation in which it nests solitarily or in small groups. Although not usual, they have been seen to nest near <span>squacco heron</span> and <span>rufous-bellied heron</span>. The nest is a platform of twigs lined with coarse grass, 23 cm &#xD7; 38 cm (9.1 in &#xD7; 15.0 in) across and 7 cm (2.8 in) deep. The nest is placed near the central trunk of the tree, on a branch or in bushes overhanging the water, at a height of over 0.5-4 m (20-157 in) above the water. They often use thorn bushes for nesting. The dwarf bittern builds its nest quickly (Tarboton 1980).</p>

using('ixobrychus sturmii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The courtship behaviour of this species is not known. The eggs are white. Some fresh eggs are faint blue, but this fades within days. Eggs are about 34 mm &#xD7; 28 mm (1.3 in &#xD7; 1.1 in). Clutches consist of three to four eggs, although the range is two to five. Incubation lasts for 18 days or longer. Nests have not been reported with asynchronously hatched young, so it is possible that incubation begins with the last eggs.</p>

<p>The Eurasian wryneck grows to between 16 and 18 cm (6.3 and 7.1 in) in length. The subspecies <i>Jynx torquilla tschusii</i> weighs 26 to 50 g (0.92 to 1.76 oz). It is a slim, elongated-looking bird with a body shape more like a thrush than a woodpecker. The upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. The rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles and irregular bands of brown. The rounded tail is grey, speckled with brown, with faint bands of greyish-brown and a few more clearly defined bands of brownish-black. The cheeks and throat are buff barred with brown. The underparts are creamy white with brown markings shaped like arrow-heads which are reduced to spots on the lower breast and belly. The flanks are buff with similar markings and the under-tail coverts are buff with narrow brown bars. The primaries and secondaries are brown with rufous-buff markings. The beak is brown, long and slender with a broad base and sharp tip. The irises are hazel and the slender legs and feet are pale brown. The first and second toes are shorter than the others. The first and fourth toes point backwards and the second and third point forwards, a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces.</p>

<p>The <span>scientific name</span> of the waterbuck is <i>Kobus ellipsiprymnus</i>. The waterbuck is one of the six species of the genus <i><span>Kobus</span></i> and belongs to the family <span>Bovidae</span>. It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. The generic name <i>Kobus</i> is a <span>New Latin</span> word, originating from an <span>African</span> name, <i>koba</i>. The specific name <i>ellipsiprymnus</i> refers to the white elliptical ring on the rump. It is composed of two <span>Greek</span> words : <i>ellipes</i>, which means lacking; and <i>prumnos</i>, which means the hind part.</p>

using('kobus ellipsiprymnus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The waterbuck is the largest of the kob antelopes. It is a sexually dimorphic antelope, with the males larger and heavier than the females. The head-and-body length is typically between 177-235 cm (70-93 in) and the average height is between 120 and 136 cm (47 and 54 in). Males reach approximately 127 cm (50 in) at the shoulder, while females reach 119 cm (47 in). Males typically weigh 198-262 kg (437-578 lb) and females 161-214 kg (355-472 lb).

<p>Almost no <span>sexual dimorphism</span> occurs in this species, although males have more curved dorsal fins with broader bases and greater surface areas. The back of the dolphin is dark grey or black, and the <span>dorsal fin</span> is distinctively two-toned; the leading edge matches the back in color, but the trailing edge is a much lighter greyish white. The dusky dolphins has a long, light-grey patch on its fore side leading to a short, dark-grey beak. The throat and belly are white, and the beak and lower jaw are dark grey. Two blazes of white color run back on the body from the dorsal fin to the tail. Right between the white areas remains a characteristic thorn-shaped patch of dark color, by which the species can easily be recognized. Aside from that, dusky dolphins may be confused with other members of their genus when observed at sea. It can be distinguished from the <span>common dolphin</span>, which has a more prominent and longer beak and yellow flank markings.

<p>In the mating groups, the males pursue a female in high-speed chases. Females seem to prefer males with great speed and agility rather than size, strength, or aggression. Females may extend the chase as long as possible so only the best male remains. Females may try to evade males that are not vigorous or lack social skill. Males also may form alliances to catch females. Unlike male bottlenose dolphins, male dusky dolphins cannot monopolize females. The time when female dusky dolphins first reproduce varies between regions. New Zealand dolphins first reproduce at about seven to years, with possibly six to seven years for Argentine dolphins. A study of dusky dolphins off the coast of Peru showed the reproductive cycle lasts around 28.6 months, with mother dolphins pregnant for 12.9 months, lactating for a further 12 months, and resting for 3.7 months before the cycle begins again. During copulation, females tend to be on the top. As with all species where females mate with multiple partners, male dusky dolphins have large testicles for <span>sperm competition</span>. Dusky dolphins sometimes engage in sexual behavior for reasons other than reproduction, perhaps for greeting, communication, or strengthening social bonds. <span>Homosexual behavior</span> between males has been observed. Dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more relaxed.</p>

<p>The <b>tropical boubou</b> or <b>bell shrike</b> (<i>Laniarius aethiopicus</i>) is a medium-sized <span>passerine</span> <span>bird</span> of <span>sub-Saharan Africa</span>. This very diverse "<span>species</span>" with its numerous <span>subspecies</span> and <span>morphs</span> has since long posed a <span>taxonomic</span> problem, and recent research suggests it is a <span>cryptic species complex</span> that ought to be split into several species.</p>

using('laniarius aethiopicus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Tropical Boubou is fairly large for its family (<span>bushshrikes</span>), measuring 23-25 cm in length. Its weight can vary between about 38-70 g, but typically adults weigh between 50 and 60 g. Females are on average a bit smaller than males, but individual variation is so large that for most practical purposes the sexes seem to be of identical size. The wing measures about 98 mm on average (between 85 and 110), the tail is a mere two millimetres longer both on average and as regards variation. The <span>tarsus</span> is c.29-37 mm long, 33 mm on average, while the bill's exposed <span>culmen</span> measures a little over 20 mm in some populations and as much as 25 mm in others. Unlike the other measurements where there is mostly individual variation, the bill length might distinctly vary between <span>subspecies</span>.</p>

using('laniarius aethiopicus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Duet type 5 of <i>major</i> consists of one to several dozen (typically about 3) short call notes given simultaneously by territorial pairs. Its loud male calls are at about 1.4 <span>kHz</span>, 0.4 <span>seconds</span> and downslurred, while the female calls increase in frequency between 900-1,000 <span>hertz</span>, are less than half as long, and begin about halfway through the males' calls. After a pair has prevailed in a song contest with an intruder, the birds quieten down for some time and ascertain that the contestant has called it quits; then, they usually move to a prominent perch, the male at the very top with his mate below, and sing duet type 5. This vocalization might be considered a sort of "victory chant", conferring information about the events to neighboring pairs.</p>

<p>The birds defend a breeding territory of 1-3 <span>hectars</span>; outside the breeding season they move about in a larger area (up to 8 hectars) and are more tolerant of conspecifics, sometimes assembling into loose noisy groups. They rarely fly long distances and tend to skulk in the shrubs and low in trees like a <span>coucal</span> (<i>Centropus</i>), or move on the ground interrupted by bouts of wathing where they stand alert, with the tail slightly raised. When alarmed, they will make a slow descending flight, flashing their white rump patches and giving warning calls, before taking cover. As usual for <span>passerine</span> birds, they scratch indirectly (foot-over-wing). <span>Allopreening</span> has been recorded between mates. At least southern birds <span>moult</span> their whole plumage after the breeding season.

<p>The <b>Long-tailed Fiscal</b> (<i>Lanius cabanisi</i>) is a species of <span>bird</span> in the <span>shrike</span> family Laniidae. The species is closely related to the more widespread <span>Grey-backed Fiscal</span> and is sometimes placed in a separate subgenus, <i>Neolanius</i>, with that species. It is found in southern <span>Somalia</span>, southern and south-eastern <span>Kenya</span>, from the shores of <span>Lake Victoria</span> to the coast; and northern and eastern <span>Tanzania</span> south to <span>Dar es Salaam</span>, with a separate population at Usanga Flats. Its natural <span>habitat</span> is open dry habitats such as dry, treeless <span>savanna</span>, open woodland and cultivated patches.</p>

using('lanius cabanisi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This conspicuous fiscal can often be seen in small groups perching in the open especially noticeable on telegraph poles and wires. It characteristically waggles its long tail from side to side excitedly. It can be distinguished from the <span>Common Fiscal</span>, <i>Lanius collaris</i>, by its gray back and more robust shape.</p>

using('lanius cabanisi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like many shrike species the appearance of the adults is similar between the sexes but strikingly different in juvenile birds. Adult birds are between 26-30 cm (10-12 in) in length and weigh between 69-80 g (2.4-2.8 oz) (with males averaging slightly heavier). They are large and robust with, as the name suggests, very long graduated tails and typical strong heavy bills.</p>

using('lanius cabanisi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Long-tailed Fiscal feeds on insects, particularly <span>beetles</span> and <span>grasshoppers</span>, as well as small vertebrates such as lizards, snakes and bird chicks. It occurs as single birds or in small groups and hunts in the typical fashion for a shrike, perched about two metres off the ground where it watches for and then dives onto prey. Prey is usually taken from the ground and sometimes from foliage, but only rarely from the air. The species has been reported to have a <span>mutualistic</span> relationship with <span>Red-billed Buffalo Weavers</span> in <span>Tsavo</span> in Kenya. The Long-tailed Fiscal benefits from associating with the weavers by snatching grasshoppers and other insects flushed by the foraging weavers, and the weavers benefited from the alarm calls made by the more vigilant fiscals.</p>

using('lanius collaris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This is a fairly distinctive 21-23 cm long <span>passerine</span> with white underparts and black upperparts extending from the top of the head down to the tail. The bird has a characteristic white 'V' on the back and a relatively long black tail with white outer feathers and white tips on the other feathers. The bill, eyes and legs are black. Adult male and female Common Fiscals are quite similar except for the rufous lower flank of the female.</p>

using('lanius collurio')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This 16-18 cm (approx. 6.3-7.1 inches) long <span>migratory</span> bird eats large <span>insects</span>, small <span>birds</span>, <span>frogs</span>, <span>rodents</span> and <span>lizards</span>. Like other shrikes it hunts from prominent perches, and impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a "<span>larder</span>." This practice has earned it the nickname of "butcher bird."</p>

<p>Once a common migratory visitor to Great Britain, numbers declined sharply during the 20th century. The bird's last stronghold was in <span>Breckland</span> but by 1988 just a single pair remained, successfully raising young at <span>Santon Downham</span>. The following year for the first time no nests were recorded in the UK. But since then sporadic breeding has taken place, mostly in <span>Scotland</span> and <span>Wales</span>. In September 2010 the <span>RSPB</span> announced that a pair had raised chicks at a secret location on <span>Dartmoor</span> where the bird last bred in 1970. In 2011, two pairs nested in the same locality, fledging seven young. In 2012 there was another breeding attempt, this time unsuccessful, probably due to a prolonged spell of wet weather. In 2013 breeding was again confirmed in Devon, with two young fledged at a new site. This return to south western England has been an unexpected development and has raised speculation that a warming climate could assist the bird in re-colonising some of its former haunts, if only in small numbers.</p>

using('lanius dorsalis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This is a fairly distinctive 21-cm-long <span>passerine</span> with white underparts and a black crown, hindneck and wings. The back is grey with a characteristic white 'V' and the rump is white. The tail is relatively long and black with white outer feathers. There is a small white patch on the wings. The bill, eyes and legs are black. The adult male and female Taita Fiscal have similar plumage except for a rufous lower flank of the female which is usually hidden by the wing.</p>

using('lanius minor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]

<p>The flight of the lesser grey shrike is low and somewhat undulating and it occasionally glides with extended wings. At the end of the flight it swoops upward to land on a new hunting perch. It then turns its head from side to side searching for prey. When on the ground it hops, but it normally only stays there for long enough to pick up an item of food. Like other shrikes, when excited it fans its tail and moves it up and down or from sided to side. It is pugnacious and will defend its nest with vigour and drive away larger birds.</p>

using('lanius nubicus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The male masked shrike is a striking bird, with black and white plumage and orange flanks. This medium-sized <span>passerine</span> is the smallest shrike at 17-18 cm in length. Its upperparts, crown, long tail and wings are mainly black; there are large white patches on the wings which are conspicuous in flight. The face is white except for a broad black line running back from the eye. The rest of the underparts are white with orange flanks. In the female and young birds the upperparts are dark grey rather than black, and the orange flanks are less bright and reduced in extent. The juvenile has heavily <span>vermiculated</span> grey upperparts, and white underparts which are also vermiculated. Masked shrike breeds in open woodland and cultivated country. The nest is built in a tree and 4-7 eggs are laid. The song is a somewhat jagged warble.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The <b>European herring gull</b> (<i>Larus argentatus</i>) is a large <span>gull</span> (up to 26 in (66 cm) long). One of the best known of all gulls along the shores of western <span>Europe</span>, it was once abundant. It breeds across <span>Northern Europe</span>, <span>Western Europe</span>, <span>Central Europe</span>, <span>Eastern Europe</span>, <span>Scandinavia</span> and the <span>Baltic states</span>. Some European herring gulls, especially those resident in colder areas, <span>migrate</span> further south in winter, but many are permanent residents, e.g. in the <span>British Isles</span>, <span>Iceland</span>, or on the <span>North Sea</span> shores. European herring gulls are also abundant around inland rubbish dumps, and some have even adapted to live in inland cities.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The male European herring gull is 60-67 cm (24-26 in) long and weighs 1,050-1,525 g (2.315-3.362 lb) while the female is 55-62 cm (22-24 in) and weighs 710-1,100 g (1.57-2.43 lb). The wingspan can range from 125 to 155 cm (49 to 61 in). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 38.1 to 48 cm (15.0 to 18.9 in), the <span>bill</span> is 4.4 to 6.5 cm (1.7 to 2.6 in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 5.3 to 7.5 cm (2.1 to 3.0 in). Adults in breeding plumage have a grey back and upperwings and white head and underparts. The wingtips are black with white spots known as "mirrors". The bill is yellow with a red spot and there is a ring of bare yellow skin around the pale eye. The legs are normally pink at all ages but can be yellowish, particularly in the Baltic population which was formerly regarded as a separate subspecies "<i>L. a. omissus</i>". Non-breeding adults have brown streaks on the head and neck. Male and female plumage is identical at all stages of development, however adult males are often larger.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>It has long been believed that the European herring gull has extremely keen vision in daylight and a night vision ability that is equal or superior to that of humans - however it is now known that this species is also capable of seeing <span>ultraviolet</span> light. The European herring gull also appears to have excellent hearing and a sense of taste that is particularly responsive to salt and acidity.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>European herring gulls may be observed rhythmically drumming their feet upon the ground for prolonged periods of time in a behaviour that superficially resembles <span>Irish stepdancing</span>. This is for the purpose of creating vibrations in the soil, driving <span>earthworms</span> to the surface, which are then consumed by the gull. It is believed that these vibrations mimic those of digging <span>moles</span>, eliciting a surface escape behaviour from the earthworm, beneficial in encounters with this particular predator, which the European herring gull then exploits to its own benefit in a similar manner to human <span>worm charmers</span>.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like most gulls, European herring gulls are long lived, with a maximum age of 49 years recorded. Raptors (especially <span>owls</span>, <span>peregrine falcons</span> and <span>gyrfalcons</span>) and seals (especially <span>grey seals</span>) occasionally prey on the non-nesting adults.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The survival rate for urban gulls is much higher than their counterparts in coastal areas, with an annual adult mortality rate of less than 5%. It is also common for each European herring gull pair to successfully rear three chicks per year. This, when combined with the long-lived nature of European herring gulls, has resulted in a massive increase in numbers over a relatively short period of time and has brought urban-dwelling members of the species into conflict with humans.</p>

using('larus argentatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Once familiar with humans, urban European herring gulls show little hesitation in swooping down to steal food from the hands of humans. During the breeding season, the gulls will also aggressively 'dive bomb' and attempt to strike with claws and wings (sometimes spraying faeces or vomit at the same time) at humans that they perceive to be a threat to their eggs and chicks &#x2014; often innocent passers-by or residents of the buildings on which they have constructed their nests. Large amounts of gull excrement deposited on property and the noise from courting pairs and begging chicks in the summer months is also considered to be a nuisance by humans living alongside the European herring gull.</p>

<p>Kelp kulls are omnivores like most <i>Larus</i> gulls, and they will scavenge as well as seeking suitable small prey. It gathers on landfills and a sharp increase in its population is therefore considered as an indicator for a degraded environment. Kelp gulls have been observed feeding on live <span>right whales</span> since at least 1996. The kelp gull uses its powerful beak to peck down centimetres into the skin and blubber, often leaving the whales with large open sores, some of which have been observed to be half a meter in diameter. This predatory behavior has been continually documented in Argentinian waters, and continues today. At rocky sites along the southern African coast, such as at Boulders Beach in Cape Town, kelp gulls (<i>Larus dominicanus vetula</i>) can be seen picking up <span>shellfish</span> and repeatedly flying up several meters and dropping them onto the rocks below in order to break them open.</p>

<p>The yellow-winged bat has a total length of 58-80 mm and a body weight of 28-36 g. Females tend to be slightly larger than males. The wingspan averages 36 cm. This species pelage is made of long hairs that are typically pearl grey or slaty gray. Males may have greenish-yellow fur on the hindparts and on the ventral surfaces. As its name suggests, the bat has wings that are reddish-yellow which is also the color of its other membranes as well as its noseleaf and ears. The membranes are largely hairless although there is some fur on the upper arms. The ears are fairly long and have a spiky tragus. It has an elongated noseleaf with a blunt but pointed tip. Although the yellow-winged bat has an advanced interfemoral membrane, it lacks an external tail.

The bat mostly lives in woodland and savannah habitats and in elevations of less than 2,000 m. It prefers acacia trees and thorn bushes near bodies of water, which it flies around. It prefers to live in areas where the vegetation is well spaced, which allows it to view more of its surroundings. The yellow-winged bat primarily roosts in small trees and shrubs. It can also be found roosting in trees cavities and buildings. It will roost in two separate trees; a primary and peripheral tree. Bats use their primary roost in the morning and again before evening. Bats travel between primary and peripheral roost trees, especially on hot days, as they may need shade. These flights are typically short but longer flights have been recorded in midday.</p>

using('lavia frons')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The yellow-winged bat is a monogamous species. Males and females form pairs during the breeding season and establish their own foraging territories. They are no more than 1 m apart when roosting together. One member is vigilant during the day and can turn head 225&#xB0; and move its ears. Between the foraging periods in the morning and evening, the male visits the peripheral roost and protecting it from potential intruders. In the morning, the pairs interact with each other before splitting up for the day. The male and female meet again at the primary roost tree before evening to interact. The maximum amount of male-female social interaction occurs between May and early June. This is when the when raining and insects are more numerous and the young hone their hunting skills. The exact time in which the yellow-winged bat gives birth, can vary by region. Parturition occurs at the close of the dry season in October in Zambia, while at Lake Baringo in Kenya, it occurs the start of the so-called long rains in April. Females are pregnant for around 3 months with only one young being born. During the first few weeks, young hang on to their mothers. Soon, the young stay at the roost for around a week and develop self-sustained flight. Young are weaned when they are around 55 days old.</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>It is a strong yet slender animal, with long legs and a fairly short tail. Due to its leg length, it is relatively one of the tallest cats. The head is small in relation to the body, and the tall, oval ears are set close together. The pattern of the <span>fur</span> is variable. Usually, the serval is boldly spotted black on tawny, with two or four stripes from the top of the head down the neck and back, transitioning into spots. The "servaline" form has much smaller, freckled spots, and was once thought to be a separate species. The backs of the ears are black with a distinctive white bar. In addition, <span>melanistic</span> servals are quite common in some parts of the range, giving a similar appearance to the "<span>black panther</span>" (melanistic leopard).</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Servals have the longest legs of any cat, relative to their body size. Most of this increase in length is due to the greatly elongated <span>metatarsal</span> bones in the feet. The toes are also elongated, and unusually mobile, helping the animal to capture partially concealed prey. Another distinctive feature of the serval is the presence of large ears and <span>auditory bullae</span> in the skull, indicating a particularly acute sense of hearing.</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Its main habitat is the <span>savanna</span>, although melanistic individuals are more usually found in mountainous areas at elevations up to 3,000 metres (9,800 ft). The serval needs watercourses within its territory, so it does not live in semi-deserts or dry <span>steppes</span>. Servals also avoid dense equatorial jungles, although they may be found along forest fringes. They are able to climb and swim, but seldom do so.</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The serval is <span>nocturnal</span>, so hunts mostly at night, unless disturbed by human activity or the presence of larger nocturnal predators. Although it is specialized for hunting <span>rodents</span>, it is an opportunistic predator whose diet also includes <span>birds</span>, <span>hares</span>, <span>hyraxes</span>, <span>reptiles</span>, <span>insects</span>, <span>fish</span>, and <span>frogs</span>. Over 90% of the serval's prey weighs less than 200 g (7 oz). The serval eats very quickly, sometimes too quickly, causing it to gag and regurgitate due to clogging in the throat. Small prey are devoured whole. With larger prey, small bones are consumed, but organs and intestines are avoided along with fur, feathers, beaks, feet or hooves. The serval uses an effective plucking technique in which it repeatedly tosses captured birds in the air while simultaneously thrashing its head from side-to-side, removing mouthfuls of feathers, which it discards.</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>As part of its adaptations for hunting in the savannas, the serval boasts long legs (the longest of all cats, relative to body size) for jumping, which also help it achieve a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), and has large ears with acute hearing. Its long legs and neck allow the serval to see over tall grasses, while its ears are used to detect prey, even those burrowing underground. They have been known to dig into burrows in search of underground prey, and to leap 2 to 3 m (7 to 10 ft) into the air to grab birds in flight. While hunting, the serval may pause for up to 15 minutes at a time to listen with eyes closed. Its pounce is a distinctive and precise vertical 'hop', which may be an adaptation for capturing flushed birds. It is able to leap up to 3.6 m (12 ft) horizontally from a stationary position, landing precisely on target with sufficient force to stun or kill its prey upon impact. The serval is an efficient killer, catching prey on an average of 50% of attempts, compared to an average of 38% for leopards and 30% for lions.</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like most cats, the serval is a solitary, nocturnal animal. It is known to travel as much as 3 to 4 km (1.9 to 2.5 mi) each night in search of food. The female defends home ranges of 9.5 to 19.8 km (3.7 to 7.6 sq mi), depending on local prey availability, while the male defends larger territories of 11.6 to 31.5 km (4.5 to 12.2 sq mi), and <span>marks</span> its territory by <span>spraying urine</span> onto prominent objects such as bushes, or, less frequently, by scraping fresh urine into the ground with its claws. Threat displays between hostile servals are often highly exaggerated, with the animals flattening their ears and arching their backs, baring their teeth, and nodding their heads vigorously. In direct confrontation, they lash out with their long fore legs and make sharp barking sounds and loud growls.</p>

using('leptailurus serval')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]

using('leptonychotes weddellii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Weddell seals measure about 2.5-3.5 m (8.2-11.5 ft) long and weigh between 400-600 kg (880-1360 lbs). Male Weddell seals weigh less than female Weddell seals, usually about 500 kg (1100 lbs) or less. Male and female Weddell seals are generally about the same size, though females can be slightly larger. However, male seals tend to have a thicker neck and a broader head and muzzle than the females. The Weddell seal face has been compared to that of a cat due to a short mouth line and similarities in the structure of the nose and whiskers. Their upturned mouths give them the appearance of smiling.</p>

using('leptonychotes weddellii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>They can also stay underwater for approximately 80 minutes. Such deep dives involve <span>foraging</span> sessions, as well as searching for cracks in the <span>ice sheets</span> that can lead to new breathing holes. The seals can remain submerged for such long periods of time because of high concentrations of <span>myoglobin</span> in their muscles.</p>

using('leptonychotes weddellii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Weddell seals' metabolism is relatively constant during deep-water dives, meaning there must be another way to account for functioning with a lack of oxygen over an extended period of time. Seals, unlike other mammals (such as humans) can undergo <span>anaerobic metabolism</span> for these extended dives, which causes a build-up of <span>lactic acid</span> in the muscles. The lactic acid does not enter the bloodstream, however, until after the animal has surfaced. This is done by constricting the capillaries going from the muscles to the veins. This requires a longer recovery time though, which in the long run, may be less efficient than quicker, aerobic metabolic dives.</p>

using('leptonychotes weddellii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>These seals also compensate for prolonged lack of available oxygen by increasing their oxygen carrying capacity, which done by having more red blood cells per unit volume of blood, as well as having more blood relative to other mammals. Typical oxygen concentration levels in human blood at sea level are about 15 ml/kg, where as Weddell seals can have 60 ml/kg. They can also release oxygenated blood from their <span>spleens</span> into the rest of their body acting as an oxygen reserve. Muscle cells also contain more myoglobin, which has a high affinity for oxygen.</p>

using('leptonychotes weddellii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Other circulatory adjustments include reducing their heart rate, and blood buffering, which prevents the pH of the blood from decreasing too much. Low pH in the blood sends a signal to the brain that it needs oxygen before it actually needs oxygen. This can be observed after holding one's breath for a long time, and then exhaling, relieving the need to breathe for a few more seconds.</p>

The gerenuk is easily recognizable from its distinctive long and skinny neck which can be elongated further if need be for activities like feeding off the taller brambles and undergrowth of the desert. It also has remarkably long slender legs which are another great advantage as they can gallop away into the distance at very high speeds from any form of predator trying to attack. However, because of the extreme length of their legs, they can be more liable to fracture of the leg bone. There have been numerous occasions in which gerenuks actually snapped their long legs due to tripping and stumbling along the ground. From head to tail, the gerenuk is around 150 centimetres (59 in) long. Males are a little taller than females, at 89-105 cm (35-41 in) tall, with the females typically 80-100 cm (31-39 in) tall. The male is also heavier than the female, weighing 45 kilograms (99 lb), while females weigh around 30 kg (66 lb). Many breeders of gerenuks and zoologists have described gerenuks as being extremely humble animals, always helping fellow gerenuks.

<p>Adult seals (over five years old) grow to an average length of 230 cm (7.6 ft) and an average weight of around 200 kg (440 lbs). Females are on average 6 cm (2.5 in) longer and around 8 kg heavier than males, though their weights fluctuate substantially according to season; females can lose up to 50% of their body weight during lactation, and males lose a significant proportion of weight as they attend to their mating partners and fight off rivals. Large crabeater seals can weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb). Pups are about 120 cm in length and 20 and 30 kg at birth.

<p>Crabeaters have relatively slender bodies and long skulls and snouts compared to other phocids. Perhaps their most distinctive adaptation is the unique dentition that enables this species to sieve Antarctic krill. The postcanine teeth are finely divided with multiple cusps. Together with the tight fit of the upper and lower jaw, a bony protuberance near the back of the mouth completes a near-perfect sieve within which krill are trapped.</p>

using('lobodon carcinophagus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Young Crabeater seals experience significant predation by leopard seals. Indeed, first-year mortality is exceedingly high, possibly reaching 80%, and up to 78% of crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from leopard seal attacks. Long scars and sets of parallel scars, visible on the otherwise pale and relatively unmarked pelage of crabeaters, are present on nearly all young seals. The incidence of visible scars falls off significantly after the first year, suggesting leopard seals primarily target the young of the year. The high predation pressure has clear impacts on the demography and life history of crabeater seals, and has likely had an important role in shaping social behaviors, including aggregation of subadults.</p>

From Harrison's personal observation of birds in captivity, each of the two forms evinced a preference for its own kind. In 1985, Kakizawa and Watada confirmed Harrison's conclusion. They confirmed the genetic difference of the two species by the means of <span>protein electrophoresis</span>. In 1990, Sibley and Monroe accept the two as distinct species. Molecular sequence divergence studies indicate that this species along with the Indian siverbill are basal, having diverged from the common ancestors of other Lonchurae about 11 MYA.

<p>The <b>maned rat</b> or <b>crested rat</b> (<i>Lophiomys imhausi</i>) is a <span>nocturnal</span>, long-haired and bushy-tailed East <span>African</span> <span>rodent</span> that superficially resembles a <span>porcupine</span>.</p>

using('lophiomys imhausi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The maned rat's body can grow up to 14 inches (360 mm) long, or 21 inches (530 mm) from head to tail. The coat consists of long, silver and black-tipped guard hairs over a dense, woolly, grey and white undercoat, with the face and limbs having short, black fur. A mane of longer, coarser black-and-white banded hairs extends from the top of the animal's head to just beyond the base of the <span>tail</span>. This mane is bordered by a broad, white-bordered strip of hairs covering an area of glandular skin.</p>

using('lophiomys imhausi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The <span>habitat</span> of the maned rat <span>ranges</span> from nearly sea level, in Ethiopia and Somalia, to more typically the drier, highland forests and woodlands of Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya. Fossil remains have been found as far north as Israel, however. They are often found in rocky areas or in hollow tree trunks and holes along the tops of ravines, and have also been found nesting among rocks on cliff-faces.</p>

<p>The digestive system of this species is unique. There is a distinctive bump along the great curvature in the stomach. It is considered to be a bilocular stomach, that aids in digesting plant-based diets. It allows adaptation to a variety of food sources. The digestive system of <i>L.sikapusi</i>, especially the stomach structure is very similar to <i>Onychomys</i>. The stomach of <i>L.sikapusi</i> does not show insectivorous diet anatomical arrangements. It is thought to aid the young to absorb large amount of milk in their stomach during period of growth. The stomach of <i>L.sikapusi</i> lacks pyloric glands. Their large stomach allows for heavy mixing of bolus after eating. Their stomach also maintains a relatively high pH range so the enzyme salivary amylase may continue to digest carbohydrates, starch, and glycogen from the food consumed. When there is inadequate water intake due to dry climates in the environment, these rodents produce concentrated urine and dry fecal matter to retain water so they may keep themselves hydrated.</p>

using('loxodonta africana')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The African bush elephant is <span>herbivorous</span>. Its diet varies according to its habitat; elephants living in forests, partial deserts, and grasslands all eat different proportions of herbs and tree or shrubbery leaves. Elephants inhabiting the shores of <span>Lake Kariba</span> have been recorded eating underwater plant life. To break down the plants it consumes, the African bush elephant has four large <span>molars</span>, two in each mandible of the jaw. Each of these molars is 10 centimetres (4 in) wide and 30 centimetres (12 in) long. Over time, these molars are worn away, and new ones are grown to replace them as the elephant ages. Around the age of 15, the <span>milk teeth</span> are replaced by new ones that last until the age of 30, and then by another set which wear off past the age of 40, being replaced by the last set of teeth that last until about the age of 65-70. Not much later, the animal dies of starvation from not being able to feed correctly. Specimens over 80 years old are known in captivity.</p>

using('loxodonta africana')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This species typically ingests an average of 225 kilograms (500 lb) of vegetable matter daily, which is defecated without being fully digested. That, combined with the long distances it can cover daily in search of more food, contributes notably to the dispersion of many plant seeds that <span>germinate</span> in the middle of a nutrient-filled feces mound. Elephants rip apart all kind of plants, and knock down trees with the tusks if they are not able to reach the tree leaves. Elephants also drink great quantities of water, over 190 <span>liters</span> (40 imp gal; 50 U.S. gal) per day.</p>

using('loxodonta africana')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Mating happens when the female becomes receptive, an event that can occur anytime during the year. When she is ready, she starts emitting infrasounds to attract the males, sometimes from kilometers away. The adult males start arriving at the herd during the following days and begin fighting, causing some injuries and even broken tusks. The female shows her acceptance of the victor by rubbing her body against his. They mate, and then both go their own way. After 22 months of gestation (the longest among mammals), the female gives birth to a single 90-cm-high calf which weighs more than 100 kg. The baby feeds on the mother's milk until the age of five, but also eats solid food from as early as six months old. Just a few days after birth, the calf can follow the herd by foot.</p>

<p>The common nightingale is an important symbol for poets from a variety of ages, and has taken on a number of symbolic connotations. <span>Homer</span> evokes the Nightingale in <span>the Odyssey</span>, suggesting the myth of <span>Philomela and Procne</span> (one of whom, depending on the myth's version, is turned into a nightingale ). This myth is the focus of <span>Sophocles'</span> tragedy, <i><span>Tereus</span></i>, of which only fragments remain. <span>Ovid</span>, too, in his <i><span>Metamorphoses</span></i>, includes the most popular version of this myth, imitated and altered by later poets, including <span>Chr&#xE9;tien de Troyes</span>, <span>Geoffrey Chaucer</span>, <span>John Gower</span>, and <span>George Gascoigne</span>. <span>T.S. Eliot's</span> "<span>The Waste Land</span>" also evokes the common nightingale's song (and the myth of Philomela and Procne). Because of the violence associated with the myth, the nightingale's song was long interpreted as a lament.</p>

using('luscinia megarhynchos')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>During the <span>Romantic</span> era the bird's symbolism changed once more: poets viewed the nightingale not only as a poet in his own right, but as &#x201C;master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet&#x201D;. For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. Coleridge and Wordsworth saw the nightingale more as an instance of natural poetic creation: the nightingale became a voice of nature. <span>John Keats'</span> "<span>Ode to a Nightingale</span>" pictures the nightingale as an idealized poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats longs to write. Invoking a similar conception of the nightingale, <span>Shelley</span> wrote in his &#x201C;A Defense of Poetry":</p>

<p>The black-collared barbet usually is about 20-25 cm long, plump-looking and has a large head. It also has the heavy bill fringed with bristles that is characteristic of the <i><span>Lybius</span></i> genus. This barbet has a very obvious black collar and head which gives reference to its name. It also has a fire-engine red coloring around the eyes and beak. It has morphologically variable coloring because there is a replacement of a red head with a black head. It also has a more intense color and is larger than other barbets. This bird is also sexually monomorphic, which means that there is generally no phenotypic difference between the males and females of this species. The morphology, size and behavior are basically the same.</p>

<p>The African wild dog lives and hunts in large packs. Like most members of the dog family, it is a <span>cursorial</span> hunter, meaning it pursues its prey in a long, open chase. These chases may occur at great speeds of up to 66 km/hr ( roughly 41 mi/hr) for 10 to 60 minutes, and over great distances (at about 50km/hr for 5.6km).  Nearly 80% of all wild dog hunts end in a kill; for comparison, the success rate of lions, often viewed as ultimate predators, is only 30%. Naturalist <span>George Schaller</span> found 9 of 10 wild dog hunts in the Serengeti ended in kills. Members of a pack vocalize to help coordinate their movements. Its voice is characterized by an unusual chirping or squeaking sound, similar to a bird. Wild dogs frequently kill larger prey by immobilization and disemboweling, a technique that is rapid and efficient but has caused this species to sometimes have a misconception (as being cruel or fierce). Because of this misconception, even a few early wildlife conservationists, such as <span>Carl Akeley</span> supported the killing of entire wild dog packs.</p>

<p>The <b>giant pangolin</b> (<i>Manis gigantea</i>) is a <span>pangolin</span> <span>species</span>. Members of the species inhabit <span>Africa</span> with a <span>range</span> stretching along the <span>equator</span> from <span>West Africa</span> to <span>Uganda</span>. The giant pangolin is the largest species of pangolins, or "scaly anteaters" - the large, scaled mammals belonging to the <span>family</span> <span>Manidae</span>. It subsists almost entirely on <span>ants</span> and <span>termites</span>. The species was first described by <span>Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger</span> in 1815.</p>

using('manis gigantea')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The giant pangolin is the largest of all pangolin species. While its average <span>mass</span> has not been measured, one specimen was found to weigh 33 kg (72.6 lb). Males are larger than females, with male body lengths about 140 cm (4.6 ft) and females about 125 cm (4.1 ft). Like all pangolins, the species is armored with large, brown to reddish-brown scales formed from keratin. Curiously, it also has <span>eyelashes</span>. The giant pangolin has a long <span>snout</span>, a long, thick <span>tail</span>, and large front <span>claws</span>.</p>

using('manis gigantea')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Because of its relatively large size, the giant pangolin is particularly well-suited to breaking open termite mounds by leaning on the mound and resting its weight on its tail, and then ripping into the mound with its front claws. The combination of weight and physical damage quickly leads to a partial collapse of the mound, exposing the termites. Only the adults are strong enough to do this; their young must follow behind their mothers until they grow large enough to do it for themselves. It eats the <span>insects</span> by picking them up with its sticky <span>tongue</span>, which is up to 16 in long.</p>

using('manis temminckii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like other pangolin species it is largely nocturnal, although it is also entirely terrestrial, and usually found in <span>savanna</span> or open <span>woodland</span>. It is well adapted to a diet of ants and termites, possessing a keen sense of smell and a very long (up to 50 cm) sticky tongue that extends deep into its abdominal cavity. Although it is capable of digging its own burrow, the ground pangolin prefers to occupy those abandoned by <span>warthogs</span> or <span>aardvarks</span> or to lie in dense vegetation, making it even more difficult to observe.</p>

using('manis tricuspis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The tree pangolin belongs to the subgenus <i><span>Phataginus</span></i>, and some authorities elevate <i>Phataginus</i> to genus status. Two subspecies were recognized in 1972 by Meester:</p>

using('manis tricuspis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The tree pangolin <span>eats insects</span> such as ants and termites from their nests, or the armies of insects moving on the trees. It relies on its thick skin for protection, and digs into burrows with its long, clawed forefeet. It eats between 5 and 7 ounces (150 to 200 g) of insects a day. The pangolin uses its 10- to 27-in (250- to 700-mm) tongue which is coated with gummy mucus to funnel the insects into its mouth. The tongue is actually sheathed in the chest cavity all the way to the pelvic area.</p>

<p>The <b>humpback whale</b> (<i>Megaptera novaeangliae</i>) is a species of <span>baleen</span> <span>whale</span>. One of the larger <span>rorqual</span> species, adults range in length from 12-16 metres (39-52 ft) and weigh approximately 36,000 kilograms (79,000 lb). The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with unusually long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. An acrobatic animal known for <span>breaching</span> and slapping the water with its tail and pectorals, it is popular with <span>whale watchers</span> off the coasts of <span>Australasia</span> and the <span>Americas</span>. Males produce a complex <span>song</span> lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Humpback whales are <span>rorquals</span> (family <span>Balaenopteridae</span>), a family that includes the <span>blue whale</span>, the <span>fin whale</span>, the <span>Bryde's whale</span>, the <span>sei whale</span> and the <span>minke whale</span>. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder <span>Mysticeti</span> as long ago as the middle <span>Miocene</span>. However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The humpback whale was first identified as <i>baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre</i> by <span>Mathurin Jacques Brisson</span> in his <i><span>Regnum Animale</span></i> of 1756. In 1781, <span>Georg Heinrich Borowski</span> described the species, converting Brisson's name to its <span>Latin</span> equivalent, <i>Balaena novaeangliae</i>. In 1804, <span>Lac&#xE9;p&#xE8;de</span> shifted the humpback from the <span>Balaenidae</span> family, renaming it <i>Balaenoptera jubartes</i>. In 1846, <span>John Edward Gray</span> created the genus <i>Megaptera</i>, classifying the humpback as <i>Megaptera longipinna</i>, but in 1932, <span>Remington Kellogg</span> reverted the species names to use Borowski's <i>novaeangliae</i>. The common name is derived from the curving of their backs when diving. The generic name <i>Megaptera</i> from the <span>Greek</span> <i>mega-</i>/&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;- "giant" and <i>ptera</i>/&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B1; "wing", refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means "New Englander" and was probably given by Brisson due the regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of <span>New England</span>.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The long black and white tail fin, which can be up to a third of body length, and the pectoral fins have unique patterns, which make individual whales identifiable. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any <span>cetacean</span>. The two most enduring mention the higher maneuverability afforded by long fins, and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly coloured <span>baleen</span> plates on each side of their mouths. The plates measure from a mere 18 inches (46 cm) in the front to approximately 3 feet (0.91 m) long in the back, behind the hinge. <span>Ventral</span> grooves run from the lower jaw to the <span>umbilicus</span> about halfway along the underside of the whale. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14-22) than in other <span>rorquals</span> but are fairly wide.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Females reach sexual maturity at the age of five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity at approximately seven years of age. Humpback whale lifespans range from 45-100 years. Fully grown, the males average 13-14 m (43-46 ft). Females are slightly larger at 15-16 m (49-52 ft); one large recorded specimen was 19 metres (62 ft) long and had pectoral fins measuring 6 metres (20 ft) each. The largest humpback on record, according to whaling records, was killed in the Caribbean. She was 27 metres (89 ft) long with a weight of 90 metric tons (99 short tons). Body mass typically is in the range of 25-30 metric tons (28-33 short tons), with large specimens weighing over 40 metric tons (44 short tons). The female has a hemispherical lobe about 15 centimetres (5.9 in) in diameter in its genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females. The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. These whales are not excessively social in most cases. Groups may stay together a little longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps considerably with other <span>whale</span> and <span>dolphin</span> species&#x2014;for instance, the <span>minke whale</span>. However, humpbacks rarely interact socially with them, though one individual was observed playing with a <span>bottlenose dolphin</span> in <span>Hawaiian waters</span>.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex "songs" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low <span>register</span>, varying in <span>amplitude</span> and <span>frequency</span>, and typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes. Humpbacks may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. <span>Cetaceans</span> have no vocal cords, so whales generate their songs by forcing air through their massive nasal cavities.</p>

<p>A large population spreads across the <span>Hawaiian Islands</span> every winter, ranging from the <span>island of Hawaii</span> in the south to <span>Kure Atoll</span> in the north. A 2007 study identified seven individuals wintering off the Pacific coast of <span>Costa Rica</span> as having traveled from the Antarctic&#x2014;around 8,300 kilometres (5,200 mi). Identified by their unique tail patterns, these animals made the longest documented mammalian migration. In Australia, two main migratory populations have been identified, off the west and east coasts, respectively. These two populations are distinct, with only a few females in each <span>generation</span> crossing between the two groups.</p>

using('megaptera novaeangliae')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Humpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century, but distinguished by whalers as early as the first decades of the 17th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean, and to a lesser extent in the <span>Indian</span> and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century introduction of the <span>explosive harpoon</span>, though, allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the <span>Antarctic Ocean</span> beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were estimated to have been taken, reducing the global population by over 90%, with North Atlantic populations estimated to have dropped to as low as 700 individuals. In 1946, the International Whaling Commission was founded to oversee the whaling industry. They imposed rules and regulations for hunting whales and set open and closed hunting seasons. To prevent <span>extinction</span>, the <span>International Whaling Commission</span> banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the population had been reduced to around 5,000. That ban is still in force.</p>

using('mesoplodon densirostris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The body of Blainville's beaked whale is robust, but also somewhat compressed laterally compared with other <span>mesoplodonts</span>. The males have a highly distinctive appearance, the jaws overarch the rostrum, like a handful of other species, but does it towards the beginning of the mandible and then sloped down into a moderately long beak. Before the jaw sloped down, a forward-facing, <span>barnacle</span> infested tooth is present. One of the more remarkable features of the whale is the extremely dense bones in the rostrum, which have a higher density and mechanical stiffness than any other bone yet measured. At present, the function of these bones is unknown, as the surrounding fat and the brittleness of the bone make it unlikely to be used for fighting. It has been suggested that it may play a role in echolocation or as ballast, but without sufficient behavioral observation, this cannot be confirmed. The melon of the whale is flat and hardly noticeable. Coloration is dark blue/gray on top and lighter gray on the bottom, and the head is normally brownish. Males have scars and <span>cookie cutter shark</span> bites typical of the genus. Males reach at least 4.4 m (14 ft 6 in) and 800 kg (1800 pounds), whereas females reach at least 4.6 m (15') and 1 tonne (2200 pounds). Juveniles are 1.9 m long (6 ft 4 in) when born and weigh 60 kg (130 lb).</p>

Unlike other species such as <span>Blainville's beaked whale</span> and <span>Andrews' beaked whale</span>, the teeth do not arch over the rostrum. The beak itself is of a moderate length. The coloration is overall dark gray on males with light patches on the front half of the beak and around the head, and small white spots on the bottom of the tail, but the location may be variable. Females are a lighter gray and have countershading. Both genders reach 4.9 meters (16 feet) in length. They are around 2.4 meters long (8 feet) when born.</p>

using('mesoplodon grayi')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Gray's beaked whale is a fairly slender member of the genus. The <span>melon</span> on the whale bulges towards the blowhole and slopes down towards the beak. The beak itself is very long and pointed for a beaked whale, and has a relatively straight mouth line. In both sexes there are 17-22 rows of small teeth located towards the back of the mouth, which barely protrude past the gum. In males, there are two small, triangular teeth present halfway down the mouth. The overall coloration is dark on top and light below, and both sexes have a white beak. Females are lighter on top and have additional white marking near the genitals. Adult males often carry linear scars that probably result from fighting, and both males and females may display circular scars from <span>cookiecutter shark</span> bites. Females reach at least 5.3 meters (17 feet 6 inches) whereas males reach 5.7 meters (19 feet) and weigh around 1100 kilograms (2400 pounds).

using('mesoplodon layardii')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The overall body shape of the strap-toothed whale is fairly typical for a mesoplodont, except for the large size. Male specimens have large and peculiar teeth even for the genus; the teeth emerge from the lower jaw and grow upward and back at a 45 degree angle to encircle the upper jaw and nearly close it. These teeth can sometimes grow to over 30 centimetres (0.98 ft) in length. The teeth have dorsally projecting denticles, and are apparently used for fighting. <span>Barnacles</span> are frequently found on the teeth, as well. Why the species would grow teeth that severely cut back on the size of prey it can consume is uncertain. The <span>melon</span> is somewhat bulbous, and blends into the beak shortly before the strap teeth. The beak itself is fairly long, with a relatively straight mouthline. The coloration of this species is also unusual for a mesoplodont, since it is rather bold; most of the body is black except for a white areas on the front of the beak, the throat, an area behind the head in a shape reminiscent of a cape, and near the genitals. Juveniles do not have this coloration and are typically <span>countershaded</span>, dark above and light below. Scars and <span>cookie cutter shark</span> bites are also present. Males can reach around 5.9 metres (19 ft), whereas females reach 6.2 metres (20 ft) and likely weigh around 1,000-1,300 kilograms (2,200-2,900 lb), indicating they are probably the largest species in the genus. Newborn calves may be up to 2.8 metres (9.2 ft) in length.</p>

using('mesoplodon mirus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This whale has a normal mesoplodont body, except that it is rotund in the middle and tapering towards the ends. The two distinctive teeth on the males are small and set on the very end of the beak. The melon is rather bulbous, and leads into a short beak. There is a crease behind the blowhole, and a sharp dorsal ridge on the back near the dorsal fin. The coloration is gray to brownish gray on the back which is lighter below, and notably darker on the "lips", around the eye, and near the dorsal fin. There is sometimes a dark blaze between the head and dorsal fin as well. One female in the Southern Hemisphere was bluish black with a white area between the dorsal fin and tail as well as a light gray jaw and throat, as well as black speckling. Scars from fighting and <span>cookiecutter sharks</span> are present on males. This species reaches around 5.3 metres (17 ft) with the females weighing 1,400 kilograms (3,100 lb) and the males weighing 1,010 kilograms (2,230 lb).

<p>The southern elephant seal is distinguished from the <span>northern elephant seal</span> (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter <span>proboscis</span>. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to their tendency to bend their backs more strongly than the northern species. This seal shows extreme <span>sexual dimorphism</span> in size, possibly the largest of any mammal, with the males typically five to six times heavier than the females. While the females typically weigh 400 to 900 kg (880 to 1,980 lb) and measure 2.6 to 3 m (8.5 to 9.8 ft) long, the bulls typically weigh 2,200 to 4,000 kg (4,900 to 8,800 lb) and measure 4.2 to 5.8 m (14 to 19 ft) long. An adult female averages 771 kg (1,700 lb) in mass, while a mature bull averages about 3,175 kg (7,000 lb). Studies have indicated elephant seals from <span>South Georgia</span> are around 30% heavier and 10% longer on average than those from <span>Macquarie Island</span>. The record-sized bull, shot in Possession Bay, <span>South Georgia</span>, on 28 February 1913, measured 6.85 m (22.5 ft) long and was estimated to weigh 5,000 kg (11,000 lb). The maximum size of a female is 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) and 3.7 m (12 ft). The eyes are large, round, and black. The width of the eyes, and a high concentration of low-light pigments, suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have hind limbs whose ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the "feet" can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile dual palm is used to propel water. The <span>pectoral</span> fins are used little while swimming. While their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly (as fast as 8 km/h (5.0 mph)) in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, to catch up with a female, or to chase an intruder.</p>

They species will nest in association with other animals, particularly where available the dams of <span>beavers</span> and also inside the nests of <span>Golden Eagles</span>. Around 3-8 eggs are laid, with the usual number being 4-6. Its <span>eggs</span> are cream-coloured, often with a faint bluish-green or turquoise tint, and heavily spotted with reddish brown; they measure, on average, 21&#xD7;15 mm (0.83&#xD7;0.59 inches). Both parents <span>incubate</span> the eggs, although the female generally does so for longer and incubates at night. The eggs begin to hatch after 12 days (sometimes as late as 16 days). Both parents feed the chicks until they <span>fledge</span> at around 14 days, and the chicks are fed for another week after fledging.</p>

<p>Grant&#x2019;s gazelles are generally mixed feeders that both browse and graze. Their average diet consists of 65.8% browse and 34.3% graze. Rainfall in their habitats seems to be the determinant of their diets. The Grant's gazelle's diet may also be responsible for the slow growth rates in the browsed plots. They get most of their moisture from the plants they eat, so they do not often have to drink water. Thus they can stay on the plains long after the rains end. From July to September, gazelles move deep into dense brush and wait for the next rains. They will eat red oats and small, tough plants, which are avoided by the other ungulates.

The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base. The bill is black in the nominate subspecies but pale or yellowish in adults of the smaller Indian <i>ginginianus</i>. <span>Rasmussen</span> and Anderton (2005) suggest that this variation may need further study, particularly due to the intermediate black-tipped bill described in <i>rubripersonatus</i>. The facial skin is yellow and unfeathered down to the throat. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage but breeding males have a deeper orange facial skin colour than females. Females average slightly larger and are about 10-15% heavier than males. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown with black and white patches.

<p>The Egyptian vulture is usually seen singly or in pairs, soaring in thermals along with other scavengers and birds of prey, or perched on the ground or atop a building. On the ground, they walk with a waddling gait. They feed on a range of food, including mammal faeces (including those of humans), insects in dung, carrion, vegetable matter, and sometimes small animals. When it joins other vulture species at a dead animal, it tends to stay on the periphery and waits until the larger species leave. Wild rabbits (<i><span>Oryctolagus cuniculus</span></i>) form a significant part of the diet of Spanish vultures. Studies suggest that they feed on <span>ungulate</span> faeces to obtain <span>carotenoid</span> pigments responsible for their bright yellow and orange facial skin. The ability to assimilate carotenoid pigments may serve as a <span>reliable signal</span> of fitness.</p>

using('neophron percnopterus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The breeding season is in spring. During the beginning of the breeding season, courting pairs soar high together and one or both may make steep spiralling or swooping dives. The birds are monogamous and pair bonds may be maintained for more than one breeding season and the same nest sites may be reused each year. The nest is an untidy platform of twigs lined with rags and placed on a cliff ledge, building, or the fork of a large tree. Old nest platforms of eagles may also be taken over. Nests placed on the ground are rare but have been recorded in subspecies <i>N. p. ginginianus</i> and <i>N. p. majorensis</i>. Extra-pair copulation with neighbouring birds has been recorded and may be a reason for adult males to stay close to the female before and during the egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month. Once the birds begin to forage on their own, they move away from their parents' territory; young birds have been found nearly 500 km away from their nest site. One year old European birds migrate to Africa and stay there for at least one year. A vulture that fledged in France stayed in Africa for three years before migrating north in spring. After migrating back to their breeding areas, young birds move widely in search of good feeding territories and mates. The full adult plumage is attained in the fourth or fifth year. Egyptian vultures have been known to live for up to 37 years in captivity and at least 21 years in the wild. The probability of survival in the wild varies with age, increasing till the age of 2 and then falling at the age of 5. Older birds have an annual survival probability varying from 0.75 for non-breeders to 0.83 for breeding birds.</p>

<p>The population of Egyptian vultures in the Canary Islands has been isolated from those in Europe and Africa for a significant period of time leading to genetic differentiation. The vulture population there declined by 30% in the ten years between 1987 and 1998. The Canarian Egyptian vulture was historically common, occurring on the islands of <span>La Gomera</span>, <span>Tenerife</span>, <span>Gran Canaria</span>, <span>Fuerteventura</span>, and <span>Lanzarote</span>. It is now restricted to Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, the two easternmost islands. The total population in 2000 was estimated at about 130 individuals, including 25-30 breeding pairs. The island birds, owing to reduced exposure to infections and low genetic diversity, appear to be more susceptible to infections due to a weaker immune response. Island birds also appear to accumulate significant amounts of lead from scavenging on hunted animal carcasses. The long-term effect of this poison at a sublethal level is not known, though it is known to alter the mineralization of their bones. In order to provide safe and uncontaminated food for nesting birds, attempts have been made to create "vulture restaurants" where carcasses are made available. However, these interventions may also encourage other opportunist predators and scavengers to concentrate at the site and pose a threat to vultures nesting in the vicinity.</p>

<p>The only similar species over most of the curlew's range is the <span>whimbrel</span> (<i>N. phaeopus</i>). The Whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter <span>bill</span> with a kink rather than a smooth curve. Flying curlews may also resemble, albeit not existing in the same area, <span>bar-tailed godwits</span> (<i>Limosa lapponica</i>) in their winter plumages; however, the latter have a smaller body, a slightly upturned beak, and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips.

<p>This is a fairly large wader though mid-sized as a member of the curlew genus. It is 37-47 cm (15-19 in) in length, 75-90 cm (30-35 in) and 270-493 g (9.5-17.4 oz) in weight. It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back and rump (subspecies <i>N. p. phaeopus</i> and <i>N. p. alboaxillaris</i> only), and a long curved <span>bill</span> (longest in the adult female) with a kink rather than a smooth curve.

using('numida meleagris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Males often show aggression towards each other, and will partake in ravenous fighting which will leave other males bloodied and otherwise injured. Attempts at making themselves look fearsome is when their wings raise upwards from their sides and feathers bristle across the length of the body, or they may also rush forwards with a gaping beak. The nest is a well-hidden, generally unlined scrape and a clutch is normally 6-12 eggs which the female incubates for 26-28 days. Nests containing larger numbers of eggs are generally believed to be the result of more than one hen using the nest; eggs are large and an incubating bird could not realistically cover significantly more than a normal clutch. Domestic birds at least, are notable for producing extremely thick-shelled eggs that are reduced to fragments as the keets hatch, rather than leaving two large sections and small chips from where any keet has removed the end of the egg. It has been noted that domesticated guinea hens are not the best of mothers, and will often abandon their nests. The keets are cryptically coloured and rapid wing growth enables them to flutter onto low branches barely a week after hatching. These guineafowl live as long as 12 years in the wild.</p>

using('numida meleagris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>It breeds in warm, fairly dry and open habitats with scattered <span>shrubs</span> and <span>trees</span> such as <span>savanna</span> or farmland. Flocks of guineafowl have flourished in recent years in the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, where they seem to have adapted remarkably well. The flocks move slowly along the quieter suburban roads, looking for food on the grassy 'pavements' and in gardens where the fence is low enough for some to enter without feeling separated from the flock. They often roost at night on the roofs of bungalows. While residents generally appreciate the local wildlife, it can be a nuisance, obstructing traffic and making a lot of noise in the early morning. Their success is probably due to the large but cautious flock - they can fend off cats, do not enter gardens with dogs, and are visible enough in the quiet roads in which they live to avoid being run over. Although many young guineafowl manage to fall down drains (and are left behind by the flock), it is not enough to restrain their numbers. Adult birds are sometimes caught and eaten by the homeless.</p>

<p>The <b>nyala</b> (<i>Nyala angasii</i> or <i>Tragelaphus angasii</i>), also called <b>inyala</b>, is a spiral-horned <span>antelope</span> native to <span>southern Africa</span>. It is a species of the family <span>Bovidae</span> and genus <i>Nyala</i>, also considered to be in the genus <i><span>Tragelaphus</span></i>. It was first <span>described</span> in 1849 by <span>George French Angas</span>. The body length is 135-195 cm (53-77 in), and it weighs 55-140 kg (121-309 lb). The coat is rusty or rufous brown in females and juveniles, but grows a dark brown or slate grey, often tinged with blue, in adult males. Females and young males have ten or more white stripes on their sides. Only males have horns, 60-83 cm (24-33 in) long and yellow-tipped. It exhibits the highest <span>sexual dimorphism</span> among the spiral-horned antelopes.</p>

<p>The coat is rusty or <span>rufous</span> brown in females and juveniles. But it grows a dark brown or slate grey in adult males, often with a bluish tinge. Females and young males have ten or more white vertical stripes on their sides. Other markings are visible on the face, throat, flanks and thighs. Stripes are very less or absent in males. Both males and females have a white <span>chevron</span> between their eyes, and a 40-55 cm (16-22 in) long bushy tail white underside. Both sexes have a dorsal crest of hair running right from the back of the head to the end of the tail. Males have another line of hair along the midline of their chest and belly.</p>

<p>The nyala can also suffer from <span>myopathy</span>. In between January 1973 and June 1981, 21 nyalas succumbed to the disease. The main symptoms were stiffness, inability to rise, and failure to suckle in newborns. <span>Necrosis</span> (that is, the premature death of cells in a living tissue) and <span>mineralization</span> were found in the skeletal muscle after a histological analysis.

<p>Wilson's storm petrel has a more direct gliding flight than other small petrels, and like most others it flies low over the seas surface and has the habit of pattering on the water surface as it picks <span>planktonic</span> food items from the ocean surface. Their unique fluttering and hovering flight is achieved often with their wings held high. Even in calm weather, they can make use of the slight breeze produced by the waves and in effect soar while using their feet to stabilize themselves. Like the European storm petrel, it is highly gregarious, and will also follow ships. A soft peeping noise is often heard while the birds are feeding. They feed predominantly on planktonic invertebrates close to the surface, rarely plunging below the surface to capture prey.

<p>English-speaking scientists most often use the term "killer whale", although the term "orca" is increasingly used. Killer whale advocates point out it has a long heritage. Indeed, the genus name <i>Orcinus</i> means "of the kingdom of the dead", or "belonging to <span>Orcus</span>".

Since the 1960s, orca has steadily grown in popularity; both names are now used.

<p>Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26 ft) long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons). Females are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7 m (16 to 23 ft) and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes (3.0 to 3.9 long tons; 3.3 to 4.4 short tons). The largest male killer whale on record was 9.8 m (32 ft), weighing over 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons), while the largest female was 8.5 m (28 ft), weighing 7.5 tonnes (7.4 long tons; 8.3 short tons). Calves at birth weigh about 180 kg (400 lb) and are about 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long. The killer whale's large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of 56 km/h (30 kn). The skeleton of the killer whale is of the typical delphinid structure, but is more robust. Its <span>integument</span>, unlike that of most other dolphin species, is characterised by a well-developed dermal layer with a dense network of <span>fascicles</span> of <span>collagen</span> fibers.</p>

Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become "rovers" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.</p>

<p>Northeast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum <span>salmon</span>, species that are insensitive to killer whale calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the <span>marine mammal</span> prey of transients hear well underwater at the frequencies used in killer whale calls. As such, transients are typically silent, probably to avoid alerting their mammalian prey. They sometimes use a single click (called a cryptic click) rather than the long train of clicks observed in other populations. Residents are only silent when resting.</p>

<p>People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous <span>anecdotes</span> demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from <span>longlines</span>, but also have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:</p>

using('orcinus orca')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Scientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied killer whales since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm killer whales. He studied killer whales from the Center for Whale Research, located in <span>Friday Harbor</span>, Washington. He was also able to study killer whales from "his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behavior displayed by the killer whales. The whales seemed "agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water" to escape the sound of the sonars. "Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometers) distant, Balcomb said." The impact of sonar waves on killer whales is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the exact day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and <span>CAT scans</span> of the two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.</p>

<p>Another conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the <span>Species at Risk Act</span> in place to protect endangered animals along their habitats) for killer whales aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government in Vancouver, Canada, claiming killer whales were facing many threats on the <span>British Columbia Coast</span> and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 killer whales on the British Columbia Coast in danger.</p>

using('orcinus orca')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including <span>Johnstone Strait</span> and <span>Haro Strait</span>. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from <span>salmon farms</span> were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the <span>Navy</span> disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with <span>whale watchers</span>, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.</p>

It is the only living species of the order <span>Tubulidentata</span>, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. It resembles a pig with a long snout, which is used to sniff out food. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the continent, avoiding mainly rocky areas. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also will utilize its digging ability to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. It receives a "least concern" rating from the <span>IUCN</span>, although its numbers seem to be decreasing.</p>

using('orycteropus afer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The aardvark is not closely related to the pig; rather, it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian <span>order</span> <span>Tubulidentata</span>, in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus <i><span>Orycteropus</span></i>, the sole surviving genus in the family <span>Orycteropodidae</span>. The aardvark is not closely related to the <span>South American</span> <span>anteater</span>, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance. The similarities are based on <span>convergent evolution</span>. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the <span>elephant shrews</span>, along with the <span>sirenians</span>, <span>hyraxes</span>, <span>elephants</span>, and <span>tenrecs</span>. With their extinct relatives, these animals form the superorder <span>Afrotheria</span>. Studies of the brain have shown the similarities with <span>Condylarthra</span>. The scientific name of the aardvark comes from <span>Greek</span> &#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3CC;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2; (<i>orykter&#xF3;pous</i>) meaning "digging footed" and <span>afer</span>: from Africa.</p>

using('orycteropus afer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The aardvark is vaguely pig-like in appearance. Its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs. The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust <span>nail</span> which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a <span>claw</span> and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered <span>digitigrade</span>, it appears at time to be <span>plantigrade</span>. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.</p>

using('orycteropus afer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>An aardvark's weight is typically between 60 and 80 kilograms (130-180 lb). An aardvark's length is usually between 105 and 130 centimetres (3.44-4.27 ft), and can reach lengths of 2.2 metres (7 ft 3 in) when its tail (which can be up to 70 centimetres (28 in)) is taken into account. It is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about 100 centimetres (3.3 ft). It is the <span>largest</span> member of the proposed clade <span>Afroinsectiphilia</span>. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by <span>soil</span>. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair. The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs. The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.</p>

using('orycteropus afer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete <span>zygomatic arch</span>. The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their <span>teeth</span>. Instead of having a <span>pulp cavity</span>, each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of <span>dentine</span>), with individual pulp canals, held together by <span>cementum</span>. The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500. The teeth have no <span>enamel</span> coating and are worn away and regrow continuously. The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and <span>canines</span> at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the <span>jaw</span>, and have a <span>dental formula</span> of: <span class="nowrap"><span style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:-0.5em; font-size:85%; text-align:center;"><span style="display:block; line-height:1em; padding:0 0.1em;" title="upper dentition: Incisors.Canines.Premolars.Molars">0.0.2-3.3</span><span style="display:block; line-height:1em; padding:0 0.1em; border-top:1px solid;" title="lower dentition: Incisors.Canines.Premolars.Molars">0.0.2.3</span></span></span> These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition. The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars. The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten <span>nasal conchae</span>, more than any other placental mammal. The sides of the nostrils are thick with hair. The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified <span>mimetic muscles</span>. The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions, but it is uncertain if it is olfactory or vibration in nature. Its nose is made up of more a <span>turbinate</span> bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5. With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist <span>epithelium</span>, which is the location of the olfactory bulb. The nose contains more <span>olfactory bulbs</span> than any other mammal, with 9. Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its <span>olfactory lobe</span> is very developed. The snout resembles an elongated pig snout. The mouth is small and tubular, typical of species that feed on <span>ants</span> and <span>termites</span>. The aardvark has a long, thin, snakelike, protruding tongue (as much as 30 centimetres (12 in) long) and elaborate structures supporting a keen <span>sense of smell</span>. The ears, which are very effective, are disproportionately long, about 20-25 centimetres (7.9-9.8 in) long. The eyes are small for its head, and consist only of <span>rods</span>.</p>

using('orycteropus afer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The aardvark is <span>nocturnal</span> and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on <span>ants</span> and <span>termites</span> (<span>formivore</span>); the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the <span>aardvark cucumber</span>. In fact, the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit, then defecate the seeds near their burrows, which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area. The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark. They avoid eating the <span>African driver ant</span> and red ants. Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive. An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 to 30 kilometres (6.2 to 18.6 mi). While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5-8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again. During a foraging period, they will stop and dig a "V" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location. When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of <span>insects</span> with its long, sticky tongue&#x2014;as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils. When successful, the aardvark's long (up to 30 centimetres (12 in)) tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers. Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns 10-40 metres (33-131 ft) long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals. The trampled grass and dung attract termites from <span>Odontotermes</span>, <span>Microtermes</span>, and <span>Pseudacanthotermes</span> genera.</p>

using('orycteropus afer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Aside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also <span>excavates</span> burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes. Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main <span>burrow</span> is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as 13 metres (43 ft). These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter. The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the <span>African wild dog</span>, <span>ant-eating chat</span>, <i><span>Nycteris thebaica</span></i> and <span>warthogs</span>. Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season. Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature. If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws. The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated <span>ant</span> nest, which also serves as protection from its <span>predators</span>.</p>

<p>The osprey differs in several respects from other <span>diurnal</span> birds of prey. Its toes are of equal length, its <span>tarsi</span> are <span>reticulate</span>, and its talons are rounded, rather than grooved. The osprey and owls are the only raptors whose outer toe is reversible, allowing them to grasp their prey with two toes in front and two behind. This is particularly helpful when they grab slippery fish. It has always presented something of a riddle to taxonomists, but here it is treated as the sole <span>living member</span> of the family Pandionidae, and the family listed in its traditional place as part of the order <span>Falconiformes</span>. Other schemes place it alongside the hawks and eagles in the family <span>Accipitridae</span>&#x2014;which itself can be regarded as making up the bulk of the order <span>Accipitriformes</span> or else be lumped with the <span>Falconidae</span> into <span>Falconiformes</span>.

<p>The osprey is 0.9-2.1 kg (2.0-4.6 lb) in weight and 50-66 cm (20-26 in) in length with a 127-180 cm (50-71 in) wingspan. The subspecies are fairly close in size, with the nominate subspecies averaging 1.53 kg (3.4 lb), <i>P. h. carolinensis</i> averaging 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) and <i>P. h. cristatus</i> averaging 1.25 kg (2.8 lb). The wing chord measures 38 to 52 cm (15 to 20 in), the tail measures 16.5 to 24 cm (6.5 to 9.4 in) and the tarsus is 5.2-6.6 cm (2.0-2.6 in). The upperparts are a deep, glossy brown, while the breast is white and sometimes streaked with brown, and the underparts are pure white. The head is white with a dark mask across the eyes, reaching to the sides of the neck. The irises of the eyes are golden to brown, and the transparent nictitating membrane is pale blue. The bill is black, with a blue <span>cere</span>, and the feet are white with black talons.

Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and for these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern.

<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the main threats to osprey populations were egg collectors and hunting of the adults along with other birds of prey, but osprey populations declined drastically in many areas in the 1950s and 1960s; this appeared to be in part due to the toxic effects of insecticides such as <span>DDT</span> on reproduction. The pesticide interfered with the bird's <span>calcium</span> metabolism which resulted in thin-shelled, easily broken or infertile eggs. Possibly because of the banning of DDT in many countries in the early 1970s, together with reduced persecution, the osprey, as well as other affected <span>bird of prey</span> species, have made significant recoveries. In South Australia, nesting sites on the <span>Eyre Peninsula</span> and <span>Kangaroo Island</span> are vulnerable to unmanaged coastal recreation and encroaching urban development.</p>

<p>Lions live for 10-14 years in the wild, while in captivity they can live longer than 20 years. In the wild, males seldom live longer than 10 years, as injuries sustained from continual fighting with rival males greatly reduce their longevity. They typically inhabit <span>savanna</span> and <span>grassland</span>, although they may take to <span>bush</span> and <span>forest</span>. Lions are unusually <span>social</span> compared to other cats. A pride of lions consists of related females and offspring and a small number of adult males. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large <span>ungulates</span>. Lions are <span>apex</span> and <span>keystone predators</span>, although they are also expert <span>scavengers</span> obtaining over 50 percent of their food by scavenging as opportunity allows. While lions do not typically hunt humans, some have been known to do so.

<p>Lions are the only members of the cat family to display obvious <span>sexual dimorphism</span> - that is, males and females look distinctly different. They also have specialised roles that each gender plays in the pride. For instance, the lioness, the hunter, lacks the male's thick mane. The colour of the male's mane varies from blond to black, generally becoming darker as the lion grows older. The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard "spine" or "spur", approximately 5 mm long, formed of the final sections of tail bone fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail - the function of the tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around 5&#xBD; months of age and is readily identifiable at 7 months.</p>

<p>The mane of the adult male lion, unique among cats, is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the species. It may provide an excellent intimidation display; aiding the lion during confrontations with other lions. The presence, absence, colour, and size of the mane is associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate, and <span>testosterone</span> production; the rule of thumb is the darker and fuller the mane, the healthier the lion. Sexual selection of mates by lionesses favors males with the densest, darkest mane. Research in <span>Tanzania</span> also suggests mane length signals fighting success in male-male relationships. Darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of the year.</p>

<p>Lions and <span>spotted hyenas</span> occupy the same ecological niche (and hence compete) where they coexist. A review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions, whether there is food or not. Lions seize the kills of spotted hyenas: in the <span>Ngorongoro crater</span>, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing the hyenas to increase their kill rate. On the other hand, in Northern Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed: hyenas frequently challenge lions and steal their kills: they obtain food from 63% of all lion kills. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30-100 m (98-328 ft) until the lions have finished, but they are also bold enough to feed alongside lions, and even force the lions off a kill. The two species may attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason. Lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in <span>Etosha</span>. Spotted hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent. The size of male lions allows them occasionally to confront hyenas in otherwise evenly matched brawls and so to tip the balance in favour of the lions.</p>

<p>Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.

Lions tend to <span>roar</span> in a very characteristic manner, starting with a few deep, long roars that trail off into a series of shorter ones.

<p>The wild animals trade flourished alongside improved colonial trade of the nineteenth century. Lions were considered fairly common and inexpensive. Although they would barter higher than tigers, they were less costly than larger, or more difficult to transport animals such as the giraffe and hippopotamus, and much less than <span>giant pandas</span>. Like other animals, lions were seen as little more than a natural, boundless commodity that was mercilessly exploited with terrible losses in capture and transportation. The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century. Explorers and hunters exploited a popular <span>Manichean</span> division of animals into "good" and "evil" to add thrilling value to their adventures, casting themselves as heroic figures.

<p>Leopards are agile and stealthy predators. Although they are smaller than other members of the <i>Panthera</i> genus, they are able to take large prey due to their massive skulls that facilitate powerful jaw muscles. Head and body length is usually between 90 and 165 cm (35 and 65 in). The tail reaches 60 to 110 cm (24 to 43 in) long, around the same length as the <span>tiger</span>'s tail and relatively the longest tail in the <i>Panthera</i> genus (though <span>snow leopards</span> and the much smaller <span>marbled cats</span> are relatively longer tailed). Shoulder height is from 45 to 80 cm (18 to 31 in). The muscles attached to the scapula are exceptionally strong, which enhance their ability to climb trees. They are very diverse in size. Males are about 30% larger than females, weighing 30 to 91 kg (66 to 201 lb) compared to 23 to 60 kg (51 to 132 lb) for females. Large males of up to 91 kg (201 lb) have been documented in <span>Kruger National Park</span> in <span>South Africa</span>; however, males in South Africa's coastal mountains average 31 kg (68 lb) and the females from the desert-edge in <span>Somalia</span> average 23 to 27 kg (51 to 60 lb). This wide variation in size is thought to result from the quality and availability of prey found in each habitat. The most diminutive leopard subspecies overall is the <span>Arabian leopard</span> (<i>P. p. nimr</i>), from deserts of the <span>Middle East</span>, with adult females of this race weighing as little as 17 kg (37 lb).</p>

<p>Other large subspecies, in which males weigh up to 91 kg (201 lb), are the <span>Sri Lankan leopard</span> (<i>P. p. kotiya</i>) and the <span>Anatolian leopard</span> (<i>P. p. tulliana</i>). Such larger leopards tend to be found in areas which lack <span>tigers</span> and <span>lions</span>, thus putting the leopard at the top of the food chain with no competitive restriction from large prey items. The largest verified leopards weighed 96.5 kg (213 lb) and can reach 190 cm (75 in) in head-and-body length. Larger sizes have been reported but are generally considered unreliable.

However, the patterns of spots in each are different: the cheetah has simple black spots, evenly spread; the jaguar has small spots inside the polygonal <span>rosettes</span>; while the leopard normally has rounder, smaller rosettes than those of the jaguar. The cheetah has longer legs and a thinner build that makes it look more streamlined and taller but less powerfully built than the leopard.

<p>Leopards must compete for food and shelter with other large predators such as <span>lions</span>, <span>tigers</span>, <span>spotted hyenas</span>, <span>striped hyena</span>, up to 5 species of <span>bear</span> and both <span>African</span> and <span>Asiatic wild dogs</span>. These animals may steal the leopard's kill, devour its young or even kill adult leopards, although lions are most likely to kill and not eat young leopards if they are discovered. Conflicts over carcasses often end without bloodshed, because leopards will often begrudgingly cede their kills if they encounter a larger-bodied or group-living predator that can potentially kill them. In some areas of Africa, troops of large <span>baboon</span> species (potential leopard prey themselves) will kill and sometimes eat leopard young if they discover them. Occasionally, <span>Nile crocodiles</span> may predate on leopards of any age. Leopards co-exist alongside these other predators by hunting for different types of prey and by avoiding areas frequented by them. Lions are occasionally successful in climbing trees and fetching leopard kills. In the <span>Kalahari</span> desert, leopards frequently lose kills to the <span>brown hyena</span>, if the leopard is unable to move the kill into a tree.

<p>Resource partitioning occurs where leopards share their range with lions or tigers. Leopards tend to take smaller prey, usually less than 75 kg (165 lb), where the larger cats are present. In areas where the leopard is sympatric with the tiger, coexistence is reportedly not the general rule, with leopards being few where tigers are numerous. Mean leopard density decreased significantly (from 9.76 animals/100km2 to 2.07 animals/100km2) when the mean density of tigers increased (from 3.31 animals/100km2 to 5.81 animals/100km2) from 2004-5 to 2007-8 in the <span>Rajaji National Park</span> in <span>India</span> following the relocation of pastoralists out of the park.  There, the two species have high dietary overlap, and an increase in the tiger population resulted in a sharp decrease in the leopard population and a shift in the leopard diet to small prey (from 9% to 36%) and domestic prey (from 6.8% to 31.8%).  In the Primore region of the <span>Russian Far East</span>, Amur leopards were absent or very rarely encountered at places where Siberian tigers reside. However, in the <span>Chitwan National Park</span> in <span>Nepal</span>, both species coexist because there is a large prey biomass, a large proportion of prey is of the smaller sizes, and dense vegetation exists. Here leopards killed prey ranging from less than 25 kg (55 lb) to 100 kg (220 lb) in weight with most kills in the 25-50 kg (55-110 lb) range; tigers killed more prey in the 50-100 kg (110-220 lb) range. There were also differences in the microhabitat preferences of the individual tiger and leopard followed over a 5-month (December to April) period in this study - the tiger used roads and (except in February) forested areas more frequently, while the leopard used recently-burned areas and open areas more frequently  Usually when a tiger began to kill baits at sites formerly frequented by leopards, the leopards would no longer come and kill there.  In the tropical forests of India&#x2019;s <span>Nagarhole National Park</span>, tigers selected prey weighing more than 176 kg (388 lb), whereas leopards selected prey in the 30-175 kg (66-386 lb) range. The average weights of leopard prey was 37.6 kg (83 lb), and of tiger prey was 91.5 kg (202 lb) with a bias towards adult males of <span>chital</span>, <span>sambar</span> and <span>wild pig</span>, and young <span>gaur</span>. In tropical forest they do not always avoid the larger cats by hunting at different times. With relatively abundant prey and differences in the size of prey selected, tigers and leopards seem to successfully coexist without competitive exclusion or inter-species dominance hierarchies that may be more common to the leopard's co-existence with the <span>lion</span> in savanna habitats. In areas with high tiger populations, such as in the central parts of India&#x2019;s <span>Kanha National Park</span>, leopards are not permanent residents, but transients. They were common near villages at the periphery of the park and outside the park.</p>

<p>Females give birth in a cave, crevice among boulders, hollow tree, or thicket to make a den. Cubs are born with closed eyes, which open four to nine days after birth. The fur of the young tends to be longer and thicker than that of adults. Their pelage is also more gray in color with less defined spots. Around three months of age, the young begin to follow the mother on hunts. At one year of age, leopard young can probably fend for themselves, but remain with the mother for 18-24 months.</p>

<p>The olive baboon is named for its coat, which, at a distance, is a shade of green-grey. Its alternate name comes from the <span>Egyptian</span> god <span>Anubis</span>, who was often represented by a dog head resembling the dog-like muzzle of the baboon. At closer range, its coat is multicolored, due to rings of yellow-brown and black on the hairs. The hair on the baboon's face, however, is coarser and ranges from dark grey to black. This coloration is shared by both sexes, although males have a mane of longer hair that tapers down to ordinary length along the back. Besides the mane, the male olive baboon differs from the female in terms of size and weight and canine tooth size; males are, on average, 70 cm (28 in) tall while standing and females measure 60 cm (24 in) in height. The olive baboon is one of the largest species of monkey; only the <span>Chacma baboon</span> and the <span>mandrill</span> attain similar sizes. The head-and-body length can range from 50 to 114 cm (20 to 45 in), with a species average of around 85 cm (33 in). At the shoulder on all fours, females average 55 cm (22 in) against males which average 70 cm (28 in). The typical weight range for both sexes is reportedly 10-37 kg (22-82 lb), with males averaging 24 kg (53 lb) and females averaging 14.7 kg (32 lb). Some males may weigh as much as 50 kg (110 lb).</p>

using('papio anubis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like other baboons, the olive baboon has an elongated, dog-like muzzle. In fact, along with the muzzle, the animal's tail (38-58 cm or 15-23 in) and four-legged gait can make baboons seem very canine. The tail almost looks as if it is broken, as it is erect for the first quarter, after which it drops down sharply. The bare patch of a baboon's rump, famously seen in cartoons and movies, is a good deal smaller in the olive baboon. The olive baboon, like most <span>cercopithecines</span>, has a cheek pouch with which to store food.</p>

<p>A female will often form a long-lasting social relationship with a male in her troop, known as a "friendship". These nonsexual affiliative friendships benefit both the male and female. Males benefit from these relationships because they are usually formed soon after he immigrates into a new group, and helps the male integrate into the group more easily. He could also potentially end up mating with his female friend in the future. Females gain protection from threats to themselves and their infants (if they have any). Also, a male will occasionally "baby-sit" for his female friend, so she can feed and forage freely without the burden of having to carry or watch the infant. These friendships are sometimes formed between sexually receptive females and newly immigrated males. These relationships are sometimes enduring and the pair will groom and remain close to each other. They will also travel, forage, sleep, and raise infants together, as well as fight together against aggressive conspecifics.</p>

<p>The <b>yellow baboon</b>, <i><b>Papio cynocephalus</b></i> is a <span>baboon</span> in the family of old World monkeys. The species epithet literally means "dog-head" in Greek, due to the shape of its muzzle and head. It has a slim body with long arms and legs and a yellowish-brown hair. It resembles the <span>Chacma baboon</span>, but is smaller and its muzzle is not as elongated. The hairless face is black, framed with white sideburns. Males can grow to about 84 cm, females to about 60 cm. It has a long tail which grows to be nearly as long as the body. Their life spans are roughly 20-30 years.</p>

using('papio ursinus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The chacma baboon is perhaps the longest species of monkey, with a male body length of 50-115 cm (20-45 in) and tail length of 45-84 cm (18-33 in). It also one of the heaviest; the male weighs from 21 to 45 kg (46 to 99 lb). Baboons are <span>sexually dimorphic</span>, and females are considerably smaller than males. The female chacma weighs from 12 to 25 kg (26 to 55 lb). It is similar in size to the <span>olive baboon</span> and of similar weight to the more compact <span>mandrill</span>, which is usually crowned the largest of all monkeys. The chacma baboon is generally dark brown to gray in color, with a patch of rough hair on the nape of its neck. Unlike the males of northern baboon species (the <span>Guinea</span>, <span>hamadryas</span>, and olive baboons), chacma males do not have a mane. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this baboon is its long, downward-sloping face. The canine teeth of male chacma baboons have a mean length of 3.86 &#xB1; 0.30 cm at the time they emigrate from their natal troop. This is the time of greatest tooth length as the teeth tend to wear or be broken thereafter.</p>

<p>In 2011, the British Television Channel <span>ITV1</span> aired an eight-episode miniseries, hosted by popular British comedian <span>Bill Bailey</span>. The series followed the lives of three different family groups of chacma baboons in South Africa. The series focuses on the baboons' abilities to adapt to human settlement and their complex social lives. It is generally structured within a narrative, with each adult baboon having a name and being treated as an 'actor' in the story. The three families of baboons have each developed their own ways of life; the 'Smitz' group spends most its time trying to rob food from tourists along a coastal highway, the 'Tokai' group has remained in a more natural forest area, and the 'Da Gama' group lives on the rooftops of an apartment complex. The program is the second attempt by Bailey to produce a semiserious nature documentary, and it received generally favourable reviews.</p>

The Latin word <i>domesticus</i> means "belonging to the house", like the common name a reference to its association with humans. The house sparrow is also called by a number of alternative English names, including <i>English sparrow</i>, chiefly in North America; and <i>Indian sparrow</i> or <i>Indian house sparrow</i>, for the birds of the <span>Indian subcontinent</span> and <span>Central Asia</span>. Dialectal names include <i>sparr</i>, <i>sparrer</i>, <i>spadger</i>, <i>spadgick</i>, and <i>philip</i>, mainly in southern England; <i>spug</i> and <i>spuggy</i>, mainly in northern England; <i>spur</i> and <i>sprig</i>, mainly in <span>Scotland</span>; and <i>spatzie</i> or <i>spotsie</i>, from the German <i>Spatz</i>, in North America.</p>

<p>The house sparrow originated in the <span>Middle East</span> and spread, along with agriculture, to most of Eurasia and parts of North Africa. Since the mid-nineteenth century, it has reached most of the world, due chiefly to deliberate introductions, but also through natural and shipborne dispersal. Its introduced range encompasses most of North America, <span>Central America</span>, southern South America, <span>southern Africa</span>, part of <span>West Africa</span>, <span>Australia</span>, <span>New Zealand</span>, and islands throughout the world. It has greatly extended its range in northern Eurasia since the 1850s, and continues to do so, as was shown by the colonisations around 1990 of <span>Iceland</span> and <span>Rishiri Island</span>, Japan. The extent of its range makes it the most widely distributed wild bird on the planet.</p>

<p>As an adult, the house sparrow mostly feeds on the seeds of <span>grains</span> and <span>weeds</span>, but it is opportunistic and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and <span>nectar robbing</span> <span>kowhai</span> flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires <span>grit</span> to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.</p>

<p>Most house sparrows do not move more than a few kilometres during their lifetime. However, there is limited migration in all regions. Some young birds disperse long distances, especially on coasts, and mountain birds move to lower elevations in winter. Two subspecies, <i>bactrianus</i> and <i>parkini</i>, are predominately <span>migratory</span>. Unlike the birds in sedentary populations that migrate, birds of migratory subspecies prepare for migration by putting on weight.</p>

<p>Young house sparrows typically remain in the nest for 11 to 23 days, normally 14 to 16 days. During this time, they are fed by both parents. As newly hatched house sparrows do not have sufficient insulation they are brooded for a few days, or longer in cold conditions. The parents swallow the droppings produced by the hatchlings during the first few days; later, the droppings are moved up to 20 m (66 ft) away from the nest.</p>

<p>Similarly, even when blind, house sparrows continue to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days are long but not when the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers on top of the head are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin at the top of the head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to daylength are located inside the brain.</p>

<p>The house sparrow has long been used as a food item. From around 1560 to at least the 19th century in northern Europe, <span>earthenware</span> "sparrow pots" were hung from eaves to attract nesting birds so that the young could be readily harvested. Wild birds were trapped in nets in large numbers, and sparrow pie was a traditional dish, thought, because of the association of sparrows with lechery, to have <span>aphrodisiac</span> properties. Sparrows were also trapped as food for <span>falconer's</span> birds and zoo animals. In the early part of the twentieth century, sparrow clubs culled many millions of birds and eggs in an attempt to control numbers of this perceived pest, but with only a localised impact on numbers.</p>

<p>For a sparrow, the Cape Sparrow is brightly coloured and distinctive, and is medium-sized at 14-16 centimetres (5.5-6.3 in) long. The breeding male has a mostly black head, but with a broad white mark on each side, curling from behind the eye to the throat. On the throat a narrow black band connects the black bib of the breast to black of the head. The underparts are greyish, darker on the flanks. The back of the male's neck is dark grey, and its back and shoulders are bright chestnut. The male has a white and a black wing bar below its shoulders, and flight feathers and tail streaked grey and black. The female is plumaged like the male, but is duller and has a grey head with a different pattern from the male, though it bears a hint of the pale head markings of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age.</p>

<p>The common diving petrel feeds on the continental shelf during the breeding season, its movements during the non-breeding season are poorly known and whether it disperses more widely is not known. Like other members of their family they catch prey by wing-propelled diving, and are capable of diving to 60 m (200 ft). The diet of this species is dominated by <span>crustaceans</span>. They are known to forage at night on vertically migrating plankton. Feeding is mostly done in the ocean near the shore, but sometimes in the deeper <span>pelagic zone</span> during non-breeding season, which is only 2 months of the year. The mating habits are not well documented, although pairs form <span>monogamous</span> relationships. Breeding colonies are large and there is about one nest per 1 square metre (11 sq ft). The nest is a burrow around 50 cm long with a chamber at the bottom which may or may not be lined with dried grass. Females lay a single white egg, which measures 38 x 29 mm, and is incubated for 53-55 days. The young are brooded for 10-15 days and fledgling occurs at 45-59 days. Both parents take care of the young, which are grey-grown when hatched. The life expectancy is 6.5 years.</p>

<p>Immature great white pelicans are grey and have dark flight <span>feathers</span>. In flight, it is an elegant soaring bird, with the head held close to and aligned with the body by a downward bend in the neck. In breeding condition the male has pinkish skin on its face and the female has orangey skin. It differs from the Dalmatian pelican by its pure white, rather than greyish-white, plumage, a bare pink facial patch around the eye and pinkish legs. Males are larger than females, and have a long beak that grows in a downwards arc, as opposed to the shorter, straighter beak of the female. The <span>spot-billed pelican</span> of Asia is slightly smaller than the great white, with clear brownish-grey plumage and a paler, duller-colored bill.

<p>Sooty albatrosses are a type of albatross that belong to <span>Diomedeidae</span> family and come from the <span>Procellariiformes</span> order, along with <span>shearwaters</span>, <span>fulmars</span>, <span>storm petrels</span>, and <span>diving petrels</span>. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called <span>naricorns</span>. Although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between 7 and 9 horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of <span>wax esters</span> and <span>triglycerides</span> that is stored in the <span>proventriculus</span>. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.</p>

<p>The light-mantled albatross is largely sooty-brown or blackish in colour, darker on the head, with paler upperparts from the nape to the upper tail-coverts which are grey to light grey, palest on the mantle and back. The plumage has been described as being similar in appearance to the colouring of a <span>Siamese cat</span>. The eyes are partly encircled with thin post-orbital crescents of very short grey feathers. The <span>bill</span> is black with a blue <span>sulcus</span> and a greyish-yellow line along the lower <span>mandible</span>, and is about 105 mm (4.1 in). Measurements show that males and females are similar in size, with average length of 79-89 cm (31-35 in), wing-span of 183-218 cm (72-86 in), and weight of 2.5-3.7 kg (5.5-8.2 lb).</p>

<p>The species breeds in loose <span>colonies</span> or small groups, and sometimes is a solitary breeder. The <span>nest</span> is built on a vegetated cliff ledge, or a steep slope, sheltered from the prevailing westerly winds. Structurally it is a low mound of peat and mud, 15-30 cm (5.9-11.8 in) high and 45-55 cm (18-22 in) wide at the base, with a cupped hollow at the top. It incorporates some plant material and a grass lining. Around October or November, a single <span>egg</span> is laid, which is not replaced if lost. Both sexes <span>incubate</span> alternately in shifts that vary from a day or two up to nearly a month in length. The incubation period is 65 to 72 days. After hatching in December or January, which takes 3 to 5 days, the chicks are brooded in shifts for about 20 days, following which they are left alone in the nests while the adults forage, returning to feed the chicks by <span>regurgitation</span> every 2 to 3 days. The entire nestling period from hatching to <span>fledging</span>, which occurs in May or June, lasts 140 to 170 days. Pairs form committed <span>pair-bonds</span> which may last for decades, being renewed through complex <span>courtship displays</span> at the breeding site. On average, birds begin breeding when they are 8 to 15 years old, after which they breed <span>biennially</span>, fledging a chick every five years or so. They are capable of breeding until at least 32 years old and living to 40 or longer.<br style="clear:left;"/></p>

<p>The common chiffchaff is a small, dumpy, 10-12 centimetres (4 in) long leaf warbler. The male weighs 7-8 grammes (0.28-0.31 oz), and the female 6-7 grammes (0.25-0.28 oz). The spring adult of the western <span>nominate subspecies</span> <i>P. c. collybita</i> has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish <span>supercilium</span>.

<p>When not singing, the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the willow warbler. However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli's warbler (<i>P. bonelli)</i> might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies <i>tristis</i>, but it has a plain face and green in the wings.

<p>The clutch is two to seven (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about 1.5 centimetres (0.6 in) long and 1.2 centimetres (0.5 in) across. They are incubated by the female for 13-14 days before hatching as naked, blind <span>altricial</span> chicks. The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14-15 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies or if the female disappears. After fledging, the young stay in the vicinity of the nest for three to four weeks, and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.</p>

<p>Running through the head are two air passages. The left passage runs alongside the spermaceti organ and goes directly to the blowhole, whilst the right passage runs underneath the spermaceti organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into the distal sac at the very front of the nose. The distal sac is connected to the blowhole and the terminus of the left passage. When the whale is submerged, it can close the blowhole, and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs.</p>

<p>When <span>echolocating</span>, the sperm whale emits a directionally focused beam of broadband clicks. Clicks are generated by the forcing of air through a pair of phonic lips (also known as "monkey lips" or "museau de singe") at the front end of the nose, just below the blowhole. The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ. Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the junk, whose lens-like structure focuses it. Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale's nose where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time. This back and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi-pulse click structure. This multi-pulse click structure actually allows researchers to measure the whale's spermaceti organ using only the sound of its clicks, and given the size of the spermaceti organ in relation to the size of the whale, biologists can measure the whales by recording their echolocation clicks. Because the IPI of a Sperm Whale's click is related to the length of the sound producing organ, an individual whale's click is unique to that individual. However, if the whale matures and the size of the <span>spermaceti</span> organ increases, the tone of the whale's click will also change. The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes. A continuous fat-filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear.</p>

<p>The most common non-human attacker of sperm whales is the <span>orca</span>, but <span>pilot whales</span> and the <span>false killer whale</span> also sometimes harass them. Orcas prey on target groups of females with young, usually making an effort to extract and kill a calf. The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them. They may face inwards with their tails out (the 'Marguerite formation', named after <span>the flower</span>). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows. Alternatively, they may face outwards (the 'heads-out formation'). Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members. If the orca pod is extremely large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales. Solitary mature males are known to interfere and come to the aid of vulnerable groups nearby. Individual large mature male sperm whales have no non-human predators, and are believed to be too large, powerful and aggressive to be threatened by orcas. In addition, male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate orca pods. An incident was filmed from a long-line trawler; an orca pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler's long lines (as the lines were being pulled into the ship) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the orca pod in attempt to drive them away; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish. The orcas employed a tail outward and tail slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking orcas.</p>

From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ports produced 45,000 barrels of sperm oil annually, compared to 8,500 of whale oil. In the same decade the British began sperm whaling, employing American ships and personnel. By the following decade the French had entered the trade, also employing American expertise. Sperm whaling increased until the mid-nineteenth century. Spermaceti oil was important in public lighting (for example, in lighthouses, where it was used in the United States until 1862, when it was replaced by lard oil, in turn replaced by <span>petroleum</span>) and for lubricating the machines (such as those used in cotton mills) of the <span>Industrial Revolution</span>. Sperm whaling declined in the second half of the nineteenth century, as petroleum came into broader use. In that sense, it may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation. Sperm whaling in the eighteenth century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats. The fleet's scope and size increased over time, and larger ships entered the fishery. In the late eighteenth century and early nighteenth century sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific, the Indian Ocean, Japan, the coast of Arabia, Australia and New Zealand. Hunting could be dangerous to the crew, since sperm whales (especially bulls) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack, unlike most baleen whales. When dealing with a threat, sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram. Arguably the most famous sperm whale counterattack occurred on 20 November 1820, when a whale claimed to be about 25.9 metres (85 ft) long rammed and sank the <span>Nantucket</span> whaleship <span>Essex</span>. Only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships. This instance is popularly believed to have inspired <span>Herman Melville</span>'s famous book "<span>Moby-Dick</span>".</p>

<p>The number of sperm whales throughout the world is unknown, but is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands. The conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales. Historically, Japan has taken ten sperm whales a year, and until 2006 tens of these whales were hunted off Indonesia. They are protected practically worldwide, and commercial whaling has ceased. Fishermen do not target the creatures that sperm whales eat. However, <span>long-line fishing</span> operations in the <span>Gulf of Alaska</span> have complained about sperm whales stealing fish from their lines.</p>

<p>Sperm whales are not the easiest of whales to <span>watch</span>, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long distances underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use <span>hydrophones</span> to listen to the clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of <span>Kaikoura</span> on <span>New Zealand</span>'s <span>South Island</span>, <span>Andenes</span> and <span>Troms&#xF8;</span> in Arctic <span>Norway</span>; as well as the <span>Azores</span>, where the continental shelf is so narrow that whales can be observed from the shore, and <span>Dominica</span> where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.

In spring and summer (late April or May to August), the adults are spotted black and white on the back and wings. The face and neck are black with a white border; they have a black breast and a white rump. The tail is white with black barring. The bill and legs are black. They moult to winter plumage in mid August to early September and retain this until April; this being a fairly plain grey above, with a grey-speckled breast and white belly. The juvenile and first-winter plumages, held by young birds from fledging until about one year old, are similar to the adult winter plumage but with the back feathers blacker with creamy white edging. In all plumages, the inner flanks and axillary feathers at the base of the underwing are black, a feature which readily distinguishes it from the other three <i><span>Pluvialis</span></i> species in flight. On the ground, it can also be told from the other <i>Pluvialis</i> species by its larger (24-34 mm (0.94-1.34 in)), heavier bill. In spring and summer, mating season comes and the adults' bellies of this species turn black whether the bird is still in its wintering place (for example, on a beach in Sanibel Island, Florida) because it does not want to migrate, or in its breeding grounds up in the arctic of northern Canada and Alaska.</p>

Martial eagles have been thought to have no distinctive display flight, but they do engage in a subtle one, with the males flying mildly around in circles. Rarely, the female joins him and the pair grasp talons with each other. During the breeding season, these typically silent birds utter a loud <span>cry</span> <i>klee-klee-klee-kloeee-kloeee-kuleee</i>. They build their nests in large trees, often placing them in the main fork of tree at 6-20 m (20-66 ft) off the ground, though nests have been recorded from 5 to 70 m (16 to 230 ft) high, in the highest cases on top of the tree canopy. Often trees used are on the sides of cliffs, ridges, valley or hilltop, with one nest having been found within a cave. In the <span>karoo</span> of <span>South Africa</span>, they have also nested on electric-power pylons. The nest is a huge construction of sticks. In the first year of construction, the nest is 1.2 to 1.5 m (3.9 to 4.9 ft) in <span>diameter</span> and 0.6 m (2.0 ft) deep. After regular use over several years, the nests can regularly measure in excess of 2 m (6.6 ft) in both diameter and depth. Martial eagles have a slow breeding rate, laying usually one <span>egg</span> (rarely two) every two years. The egg is incubated for 45 to 53 days and the chick fledged at 96 to 104 days. Despite increasing signs of independence (such as flight and beginning to practice hunting), juvenile birds will remain in the care of their parents for a further 6 to 12 months. Due to this long dependence period, these eagles can usually only mate in alternate years.</p>

<p>The <b>aardwolf</b> (<i>Proteles cristata</i>) is a small, <span>insectivorous</span> <span>mammal</span>, native to <span>East Africa</span> and <span>Southern Africa</span>. Its name means "earth wolf" in the <span>Afrikaans</span> / <span>Dutch language</span>. It is also called "maanhaar jackal", or <i>civet hyena</i>, based on the secretions (civet) from their anal glands. The aardwolf is in the same family as the <span>hyenas</span>. Unlike many of its relatives in the order <span>Carnivora</span>, the aardwolf does not hunt large <span>animals</span>, or even eat meat on a regular basis; instead it eats <span>insects</span>, mainly <span>termites</span> - one aardwolf can eat about 250,000 termites during a single night by using its long, sticky <span>tongue</span> to capture them. The aardwolf lives in the scrublands of eastern and southern Africa - these are open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs. The aardwolf is <span>nocturnal</span>, resting in <span>burrows</span> during the day and emerging at night to seek food. Their diet consists mainly of termites, and insect <span>larvae</span>.</p>

using('proteles cristata')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The aardwolf resembles a very thin <span>striped hyena</span>, but with a more slender <span>muzzle</span>, black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur, and a long, distinct <span>mane</span> down the midline of the neck and back. They also have one or two diagonal stripes down the fore and hindquarters, along with several stripes on its legs. The mane is raised during confrontations in order to make the aardwolves appear larger. It is missing the throat spot that others in the family have. It's lower leg (from the knee down) is all black, and its tail is bushy with a black tip. The aardwolf is about 55 to 80 centimetres (22 to 31 in) long, excluding its bushy tail, which is about 20-30 centimetres (7.9-11.8 in) long, and stands about 40 to 50 centimetres (16 to 20 in) tall at the shoulders. An adult aardwolf weighs approximately 7-10 kilograms (15-22 lb), sometimes reaching 15 kilograms (33 lb). The aardwolfs in the south of the continent tend to be smaller (about 10 kilograms (22 lb)), whereas the eastern version weighs more (around 14 kilograms (31 lb)). The front feet have five toes each, unlike the four-toed hyena. The teeth and skull are similar to those of the hyena, though smaller, and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects. It does still have canines; however unlike the hyena, these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense. Its ears, which are large, are very similar to the <span>Striped Hyena</span>.</p>

using('proteles cristata')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The territory is marked by both sexes, as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in 5-millimetre (0.20 in) long streaks. They often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so. If they are patrolling their territorial boundaries, the marking frequency increases drastically, to once every 50 metres (160 ft). At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour, and upwards of 200 per night.</p>

<p>The aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on <i><span>Trinervitermes</span></i>. This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolfs range. In East Africa, they eat <i><span>Trinervitermes bettonianus</span></i>, and in central Africa they eat <i><span>Trinervitermes rhodesiensis</span></i>, and finally in southern Africa, they eat <i><span>Trinervitermes trinervoides</span></i>. Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the <span>aardvark</span> which will dig into the mound. They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites. An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 <span>termites</span> per night using its sticky, long tongue. They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They will often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months. During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of mid-winter, the primary termites become scarce and so the need for other forms of sustenance becomes pronounced. During these times the southern aardwolf will seek out <i><span>Hodotermes mossambicus</span></i>, a type of <span>harvester termite</span>, a termite active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter. The eastern aardwolf will, during the rainy season, get variety by subsisting on termites from the <i><span>Odontotermes</span></i> and <i><span>Macrotermes</span></i> genera. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs and, some sources say, occasionally small <span>mammals</span> and <span>birds</span>, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet. Unlike other <span>hyenas</span>, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals. Contrary to popular myths, aardwolfs do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, it is actually eating larvae and beetles. Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them. The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, however more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers, necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey.

However, their efforts were futile with most animals re-beaching themselves and the weather complicating further attempts. By late morning, the authorities decided to ask volunteers to stabilize the false killers whales on the beach. No further attempt was made to take the whales into the open sea. At about 4 pm after considerable debate by all the authorities present, the decision was made to initiate euthanasia by shooting the whales; around 44 whales were killed.</p>

<p>Breeding takes place at any time of the year and is dependent on rainfall. Usually the nests are solitary but sometimes several pairs of birds choose sites near each other. The nest is a scrape in the earth, scantily lined with dried plant material. Two or three pinkish-grey eggs with brown markings are laid over the course of a few days. Incubation starts after the last egg has been laid and lasts about 22 days. The female does the incubation by day and the male does a longer shift at night, starting about two hours before sunset and finishing two hours after dawn. The chicks are <span>precocial</span> and able to leave the nest on the day they are hatched. The male brings them water absorbed on the specially adapted feathers of his breast.

<p>The rock martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, although it will occasionally feed on the ground. When breeding, birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to the nesting territory. At other times, they may hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include <span>mosquitoes</span> and other <span>flies</span>, <span>Hymenoptera</span>, <span>ants</span> and <span>beetles</span>. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at <span>grass fires</span> to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant. Cliff faces generate <span>standing waves</span> in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.</p>

<p>A study of nine bird species including four hirundines showed that the more young there are in a nest, the more frequent are the parents' feeding visits, but the visits do not increase in proportion to the number of young. On average a solitary nestling therefore gets more food than a member of a pair or of a trio. Since the nestling period is not prolonged in proportion to the drop in feeding rate, an individual fledgling from a larger brood is likely to weigh less when it leaves the nest. However, a subspecies of the rock martin (<i>P. f. fusciventris</i>) was an anomaly in respect of both feeding rate and nestling time. There was no difference in parental feeding rate for members of a pair and members of a trio, but the nestling period averaged 1.5 days longer for trios than pairs.</p>

<p>They are spectacular long-distance <span>migrants</span>, following a circular route, traveling north up the western side of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the end of the nesting season in March-May, reaching subarctic waters in June-July where they cross from west to east, then returning south down the eastern side of the oceans in September-October, reaching to the breeding colonies in November. They do not migrate as a flock, but rather as single individuals, associating only opportunistically; in June 1906 for example, two were shot near <span>Guadalupe Island</span> off <span>Baja California</span>, <span>Mexico</span>, several weeks before the bulk of the population would pass by. Likewise, the identity of numerous large dark shearwaters observed in October 2004 off <span>Kwajalein</span> in the <span>Marshall Islands</span> remains enigmatic; they might have been either sooty or <span>short-tailed shearwaters</span>, but neither species is generally held to pass through this region at that time.</p>

Nesting either in <span>burrows</span> or sometimes on the surface under cover. Pairs call frequently as a pair, both to reinforce the pair bond and warn intruders away from their territory. Parents also call to their chicks. The call is long, with an inhaling component (OOO) and exhaling component (err); their Hawaiian name <b>&#x2019;ua&#x2019;u kani</b> means moaning petrel. Both sexes participate in digging a burrow, or repairing the burrow from last year. Nesting burrows of other species are also used. The breeding season of the <span>Bonin petrel</span> in Hawaii is timed to avoid that of the wedge-tail; in years where Bonin petrel chicks are still in burrows when wedge-tails return to begin breeding these chicks are killed or evicted. It attends these colonies <span>nocturnally</span>, although non-breeding wedge-tails are often seen at the surface throughout the day and breeding birds will rest outside their burrows before laying.</p>

using('puffinus pacificus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Both sexes undertake a prelaying exodus in order to build up energy reserves, this usually lasts around 28 days. A single egg is laid, if that egg is lost then the pair will not attempt another that season. After laying, the male usually undertakes the first incubation stint. Both sexes incubate the egg, in stints that can last up to 13 days. Incubation takes around 50 days. After hatching, the chick is brooded for up to six days, until it is able to <span>thermoregulate</span>, after which it is left alone in the nest while both parents hunt for food. It is initially fed with <span>stomach oil</span>, an energy rich waxy oil of digested prey created in the parent&#x2019;s gut; later it is fed both solids and stomach oil. Like many procellariids, wedge-tailed shearwater parents alternate long and short trips to provide food, with the parents alternating between short foraging trips (1-4 days) and long trips (about 8 days), the two parents coordinating their feeding effort. Chicks increase in size to 560 g (larger than the adults) then drop to around 430 g before <span>fledging</span>. Fledging occurs after 103-115 days, after which the chick is independent of the adult.</p>

The head-and-body length of this medium-sized antelope is typically between 100-135 cm (39-53 in). Males reach approximately 75-89 cm (30-35 in) at the shoulder, while females reach 69-76 cm (27-30 in). Males typically weigh 43-65 kg (95-143 lb) and females 35-45 kg (77-99 lb). This sturdily built antelope has a yellow to grayish brown coat. Only the males possess horns which measure about 25-35 cm (9.8-13.8 in) long.</p>

<p>A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers grasses and tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is dependent on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become <span>sexually mature</span> at the age of three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.</p>

Reckless hunting and loss of habitat as a result of human settlement have led to significant decline in the numbers of the bohor reedbuck, although this antelope tends to survive longer in such over-exploited areas as compared to its relatives. The total populations of the bohor reedbuck are estimated to be above 100,000. Larger populations occur in eastern and central Africa than in western Africa.

<p>This sturdily built antelope has a yellow to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse <span>sebaceous glands</span> present on the coat make the coat greasy and give it a strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While <i>R. r. bohor</i> appears yellowish gray, <i>R. r. wardi</i> is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed&#x2014;such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. However, <i>R. r. redunca</i> lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and <span>vestigial</span> foot glands, and four <span>nipples</span>. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the <span>southern reedbuck</span>.</p>

using('redunca redunca')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>As a prominent sign of sexual dimorphism, only males possess a pair of short, stout horns, that extend backward from the forehead and hook slightly forward. The horns measure about 25-35 cm (9.8-13.8 in). However, some Senegalese individuals have longer and wide-spreading horns. In comparison to the other reedbucks, the bohor reedbuck has the shortest and most hooked horns. The longest horns are observed in <i>R. r. cottoni</i>, which are hooked less than normal and may curve inwards. In contrast to <i>R. r. cottoni</i>, <i>R. r. bohor</i> has short and stout horns, with hooks pointing forward. The length of the horns of an individual of a certain region seems to be related to the population density in that region to some extent. While short horns are observed in individuals of eastern Africa, where populations are dispersed, longer and wide-spreading horns are found on animals in the <span>Nile valley</span>, where populations are concentrated.</p>

<p>If shade is available, females remain solitary; otherwise they, along with their offspring, congregate to form herds of ten animals. Female home ranges span over 15-40 <span>hectares</span> (37-99 <span>acres</span>; 0.058-0.154 <span>sq mi</span>), while the larger <span>territories</span> of males cover 25-60 <span>hectares</span> (62-148 <span>acres</span>; 0.097-0.232 <span>sq mi</span>). These home ranges keep overlapping. As the daughters grow up, they distance themselves from their mothers' home ranges. Territorial males are much tolerant; they may even associate with up to 19 bachelor males in the absence of females. As many as five females may be found in a male's territory. Territorial bulls drive out their sons when they start developing horns (when they are about a year-and-a-half old). These young males form groups of two to three individuals on the borders of territories, till they themselves mature in their fourth year. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river.</p>

<p>Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck may also feed at daytime. A study showed that feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were observed once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse a long way from their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in the amount of time spent while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as <span>hartebeest</span>, topi, puku and <span>kob</span>. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.</p>

<p>The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The mothers keep their offspring concealed for as long as eight weeks. The mother keeps within a distance of 20-30 m (66-98 ft) of its calf. Nursing, usually two to four minutes long, involves licking the whole body of the calf and suckling. The infant is suckled usually once in the day and one to two times at night. The female's previous calf usually resists separation. At the age of two months, the calf begins grazing alongside its mother, and seeks protection from her if alarmed. Though after four months the calf is no more licked, it may still be groomed by its mother. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.</p>

<p>The banded martin, unlike the other members of its genus, is not colonial in its nesting habits. Its nest is at the end of a 60-90 cm long tunnel usually excavated by the birds in a natural sand bank or earth mound.

using('sagittarius serpentarius')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Its common name is popularly thought to derive from the crest of long quill-like <span>feathers</span>, lending the bird the appearance of a secretary with quill pens tucked behind their ear, as was once common practice.

using('sagittarius serpentarius')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The secretarybird is instantly recognizable as having an eagle-like body on <span>crane-like</span> legs which increases the bird&#x2019;s height to as much as 1.3 m (4 ft) tall. This <span>bird</span> has an <span>eagle-like</span> head with a hooked <span>bill</span>, but has rounded wings. Body weight can range from 2.3 to 4.6 kg (5.1 to 10.1 lb) and height is 90-137 cm (35-54 in). Total length from 112 to 152 cm (44 to 60 in) and the wingspan is 191-220 cm (75-87 in). The tarsus of the secretarybird averages 31 cm (12 in) and the tail is 57-85 cm (22-33 in), both of which factor into making them both taller and longer than any other species of <span>raptor</span>. The neck is not especially long, and can only be lowered down to the inter-tarsal joint, so birds reaching down to the ground or drinking must stoop to do so.</p>

using('sagittarius serpentarius')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>From a distance or in flight it resembles a <span>crane</span> more than a bird of prey.

Secretarybird <span>flight feathers</span> and thighs are black, while most of the coverts are grey with some being white. Sexes look similar to one another as the species exhibits very little <span>sexual dimorphism</span>, although the male has longer head plumes and tail feathers.

using('sagittarius serpentarius')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Unlike most <span>birds of prey</span>, the secretarybird is largely <span>terrestrial</span>, hunting its prey on foot.

The shape of its head with a long bill and crest at the back is reminiscent of a hammer, hence its name. It ranges from <span>Africa</span>, <span>Madagascar</span> to <span>Arabia</span>, in <span>wetlands</span> of a wide variety, including <span>estuaries</span>, lakesides, fish ponds, <span>riverbanks</span> and rocky coasts in <span>Tanzania</span>. The hamerkop, which is a <span>sedentary</span> bird that often show local movements, is not globally threatened and is locally abundant in Africa and Madagascar.</p>

using('scopus umbretta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Its plumage is a drab brown with purple <span>iridescence</span> on the back (the subspecies <i>S. u. minor</i> is darker). The bill is long, flat, and slightly hooked. The neck and legs are shorter than those of most of the <span>Ciconiiformes</span>. The hamerkop has, for unknown reasons, partially webbed feet. The middle toe is comb-like (pectinated) like a <span>heron</span>'s. Its tail is short and its wings are big, wide, and round-tipped; it soars well. When it does so, it stretches its neck forward like a <span>stork</span> or <span>ibis</span>, but when it flaps, it coils its neck back something like a heron.</p>

using('scopus umbretta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The strangest aspect of hamerkop behaviour is the huge nest, sometimes more than 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) across, comprising perhaps 10,000 sticks and strong enough to support a man's weight. The birds decorate the outside with any bright-coloured objects they can find. When possible, they build the nest in the fork of a tree, often over water, but if necessary they build on a bank, a cliff, a human-built wall or dam, or on the ground. A pair starts by making a platform of sticks held together with mud, then builds walls and a domed roof. A mud-plastered entrance 13-18 centimetres (5.1-7.1 in) wide in the bottom leads through a tunnel up to 60 centimetres (24 in) long to a nesting chamber big enough for the parents and young.</p>

using('scopus umbretta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>At the finished nest, a pair gives displays similar to those of the group ceremonies and mates, often on top of the nest. The clutch consists of three to seven eggs which start white but soon become stained. Both sexes incubate for 28 to 30 days. Both feed the young, often leaving them alone for long times; this unusual habit for wading birds may be made possible by the thick nest walls. The young hatch covered with grey down. By 17 days after hatching, their head and crest plumage is developed, and in a month, their body plumage. They leave the nest at 44 to 50 days but roost in it at night until about two months after hatching.</p>

using('scopus umbretta')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Hamerkops feed during the day, often taking a break at noon to roost. They normally feed alone or in pairs. The food is typical of long-legged wading birds, and the most important is amphibians. They also eat fish, shrimp, insects and rodents. They walk in shallow water looking for prey, shuffling one foot at a time on the bottom or suddenly opening their wings to flush prey out of hiding. The same shuffling technique is used to locate food in middens of fish remains.</p>

using('scotopelia peli')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Pel's fishing owl is one of the largest owl species in the world. It measures 51-63 cm (20-25 in) in length, spans around 153 cm (60 in) across the wings and weighs 2-2.35 kg (4.4-5.2 lb). Under current classification, it is the heaviest extant owl outside of the <i><span>Bubo</span></i> genus. Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 40.7-44.7 cm (16.0-17.6 in) and the tail is 20.7-24.3 cm (8.1-9.6 in) long. They are well adapted to their aquatic lifestyle. Unlike most owls, they have minimal feathering on the toes and the tarsus, thus minimizing the amount of plumage that gets wet while fishing. Like diurnal raptors that specialize in fish, they have spiky scales on the bottoms of their feet that help them grip slippery fish. Since hearing and auditory stealth is not important to its hunting techniques, this owl does not have strong hearing and does not have the soft edges to its flight feathers that most owls share, which makes them almost impossible to hear in flight.</p>

using('scotopelia peli')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Adults are rich ginger-<span>rufous</span> with dense dark bars to the upperparts and scaling to the underparts. The feathers around the head are loose and long, giving the head a shaggy appearance. The tarsi and toes are unfeathered and straw-colored. The white throat is often largely obscured but can be puffed up in displaying birds during courtship. The flight and tail feathers are barred with lighter and darker feathers. The eyes are distinctly dark, often blackish in color. The two adult sexes are similar looking but females are generally less rufous in color and have a more indistinct facial disc. There is considerable variation in coloration and barring in adult birds, with some birds having extensive pale feathers with others having several blackish markings. Juveniles are more uniform <span>buff</span> than adults. Unlike the <span>eagle-owls</span>, the ear tufts of the Pel's fishing owl are barely visible, giving it a very round-headed appearance. The two related <span>fishing owls</span> are smaller and lack the dark barring and scaling (though they do have dark streaks below).</p>

using('scotopelia peli')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Pel's fishing owl is found in forests along rivers and lakes. They can found in swamps and estuaries at sea level up to an elevation of around 1,700 m (5,600 ft). The favorite habitat is riverine forests with large trees, although large numbers are also found on islands of large, old trees within larger rivers, swamps or lakes, so long as the islands are not too far from the bank. The species is largely residential and has no seasonal movement, although young, non-breeding birds may wander somewhat before claiming their own territories. Pel's fishing owl may move outside of their own range in pursuit of prey.</p>

using('scotopelia peli')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The main prey of Pel's fishing owl is, of course, fish. They can take fish weighing at least 2 kg (4.4 lb) but a majority of fish caught are much smaller, regularly weighing 100-200 g (3.5-7.1 oz). They are not picky eaters among fish species and any fish that is in a reasonable size range and found close to the water's surface is ready caught and consumed. Compared with the <span>fish owls</span>, the three <span>fishing owls</span> are more completely piscivorous and rarely vary their prey selection from fish. However, seldom, they will also take other aquatic animals such as <span>frogs</span>, <span>crabs</span>, <span>mussels</span> and large <span>insects</span>. In one case, a Pel's fishing owl was observed to predate a baby <span>Nile crocodile</span>. While perched over the water, these owls detect the movement of fish from ripples in the water and swoop down to seize their prey with their powerful talons and then swoop back to their perch for consumption. Unlike many other fish-eating birds, Pel's fishing owl rarely submerge themselves or get particularly wet while hunting. More uncommonly, this species will forage by wading into shallow water along sandbanks.</p>

using('scotopelia peli')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Pel's fishing owls nest during the dry season, which has the benefit of lower, clearer water and thus more easily detectable fish. They are monogamous and territorial, claiming a stretch of river or lakeshore for themselves. All life history activity in the species occurs within striking distance of water. Territories are claimed by hooting at the start of the breeding season. When prey selection is good, populations can be quite dense. At such bountiful times, territories are often quite small with the central activity of breeding pairs sometimes occurring within 300 m (980 ft) of each other. In <span>Botswana</span>, 23 territories were found along 60 km of river and, in <span>Kruger National Park</span>, up to 8 pairs can be found in an 18 km stretch of the Levubu River.</p>

Based on a survey done in 2002 and 2003, they are often found in waters &lt;5m deep, and no evidence shows that they appear in water deeper than 15m. A study in 2008 found that the population of humpback dolphins, which occupies a linear range of about 500 km^2 along the central west coast of Taiwan, is genetically distinct from all populations living in other areas. And this population is called eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) population.</p>

using('sousa chinensis')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Taiwan is a densely populated island and highly developed country, which has many industrial development projects, especially along the west coast, where the ETS populations of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins live. Based on data collected between 2002 and 2005, the ETS population of humpback dolphins was less than 100 individuals. Unfortunately, the newest data released in 2012 shows that only 62 individuals are left. It means during those 7 years, population of humpback dolphins is being destroyed constantly and severely. A preliminary examination revealed that the ETS humpback dolphin population meets the IUCN Red List criteria for &#x201C;Critically Endangered&#x201D;. Without further protection and regulation, this population will go extinct quickly.</p>

<p>Second, fishing activities along the west coast of Taiwan are thriving, and cause many impacts on dolphins. Widespread and intensive use of gillnets and vessel strikes are potential threats for dolphins. Over exploitation of fish by fisheries&#x2019; is another threat for the dolphin population. It has led to disturbance of marine food web or trophic level and reduces marine biodiversity. Therefore, dolphins have not enough prey to live on.</p>

<p>Disaster struck on 23 June 2000, when the iron ore tanker MV <i>Treasure</i> sank between <span>Robben Island</span> and <span>Dassen Island</span>, South Africa. It released 1,300 tons of fuel oil, causing an unprecedented coastal bird crisis, oiling 19,000 adult penguins at the height of the best breeding season on record for this vulnerable species. The oiled birds were brought to an abandoned train repair warehouse in <span>Cape Town</span> to be cared for. An additional 19,500 un-oiled penguins were removed from Dassen Island and other areas before they became oiled, and were released about 800 kilometres east of Cape Town, near Port Elizabeth. This gave workers enough time to clean up the oiled waters and shores before the birds could complete their long swim home (which took the penguins between one and three weeks).

The species is found in much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. It is also found in Israel, Lebanon, Syria, the UAE and Turkey (these populations may be derived from human introductions). They are mostly sedentary but some populations may make movements. Birds ringed in Gujarat have been recovered 200 km north in Pakistan and exhausted birds have been recorded landing on ships in the Arabian Sea. The species (thought to belong to the nominate population) was introduced to Perth in 1889 and has become established around Western Australia.

<p>This species was described by Linnaeus who placed it in the genus <i>Columba</i> along with other pigeons.

Some authors have argued that <i>Stigmatopelia</i> is the valid name as it has priority due to appearing in an earlier line on the page but Schodde and Mason in their zoological catalogue of Australian birds chose <i>Spilopelia</i> citing clause 24(b) of the ICZN Code which supports the decision of the first reviser.</p>

<p>The striped dolphin has a similar size and shape to several other dolphins that inhabit the waters it does (see <span>pantropical spotted dolphin</span>, <span>Atlantic spotted dolphin</span>, Clymene dolphin). However, its colouring is very different and makes it relatively easy to notice at sea. The underside is blue, white, or pink. One or two black bands circle the eyes, and then run across the back, to the flipper. These bands widen to the width of the flipper which are the same size. Two further black stripes run from behind the ear &#x2014; one is short and ends just above the flipper. The other is longer and thickens along the flanks until it curves down under the belly just prior to the tail stock. Above these stripes, the dolphin's flanks are coloured light blue or grey. All appendages are black, as well. At birth, individuals weigh about 10 kg (22 lb) and are up to a meter (3 feet) long. By adulthood, they have grown to 2.4 m (8 ft) (females) or 2.6 m (8.5 ft) (males) and weigh 150 kg (330 lb) (female) or 160 kg (352 lb) (male). Research suggested sexual maturity was reached at 12 years in Mediterranean females and in the Pacific at between seven and 9 years.

<p>The <b>spinner dolphin</b> (<i>Stenella longirostris</i>) is a small <span>dolphin</span> found in off-shore tropical waters around the world.

<p>The spinner dolphin is sometimes referred to as the <b>long-snouted dolphin</b>, particularly in older texts, to distinguish it from the similar Clymene dolphin, which is often called the short-snouted spinner dolphin. The species was described by John Edward Gray|John Gray in 1828. The four named subspecies are:</p>

<p>The zoology comes from the Latin term for long-beaked.</p>

<p>The spinner dolphin is a small cetacean with a slim build. Adults are typically 129-235 cm long and reach a body mass of 23-79 kg. This species has an elongated rostrum and a triangular or subtriangular dorsal fin. Spinner dolphins generally have tripartite color patterns. The dorsal area is dark gray, the sides light gray, and the underside pale gray or white. Also, a dark band runs from the eye to the flipper, bordered above by a thin, light line. However, the spinner dolphin has more geographic variation in form and coloration than other cetaceans. In the open waters of eastern Pacific, dolphins have relatively small skulls with short rostra. A dwarf form of spinner dolphin occurs around southeast Asia. In these same subspecies, a dark dorsal cape dims their tripartite color patterns. Further offshore, subspecies tend to have a paler and less far-reaching cape. In certain subspecies, some males may have upright fins that slant forward. Some populations of spinner dolphin found in the eastern Pacific have bizarre backwards-facing dorsal fins, and males can have strange humps and upturned caudal flukes.</p>

using('stenella longirostris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In certain regions, such as Hawaii and northern Brazil, dolphins spend the daytime resting in shallow bays near deep water. At dusk, they travel offshore to feed. They travel along the shore during foraging trips, and the individuals that occupy the same bay may change daily. Some individual dolphins do not always go to a bay to rest; however, in Hawaii, dolphins do seem to return to the same site each trip. Spinner dolphins live in an open and loose social organization. The spinner dolphins of Hawaii live in family groups, but also have associations with others beyond their groups. Mothers and calves form strong social bonds. Spinner dolphins seem to have a promiscuous mating system, with individuals changing partners for up to some weeks. A dozen adult males may gather into <span>coalitions</span>. Vocalizations of spinner dolphins include whistles, which may be used to organize the school, burst-pulse signals, and echolocation clicks. The spinner dolphin has a 10-month gestation period, and mothers nurse their young for one to two years. Females are sexually mature at four to seven years, with three-year calving intervals, while males are sexually mature at seven to 10 years. Breeding is seasonal, more so in certain regions than others.</p>

It often preys on mammals such as <span>Bushbuck</span> (<i>Tragelaphus scriptus</i>), exceptionally weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) albeit usually much less. The Crowned Eagle possesses unusually large talons and strong hindlegs, and may kill by crushing the skull.

<p>The Crowned Eagle is a very large eagle. Measuring from 80 to 99 cm (31 to 39 in) in length, it is the fifth longest extant eagle in the world. The female, at a weight of 3.2-4.7 kg (7 lb 1 oz-10 lb 6 oz), is around 10-15% larger than the male, at a weight of 2.55-4.12 kg (5 lb 10 oz-9 lb 1 oz). An average body mass of 3.64 kg (8.0 lb) was given in one account. Elsewhere, an average of 3.8 kg (8.4 lb) has been claimed. Overall, they are the 9th heaviest living eagle species. The wingspan typically ranges from 1.51 to 1.81 m (4 ft 11 in to 5 ft 11 in). The largest authenticated wingspan for a female was 1.9 m (6 ft 3 in), with a claim of wingspans of up to 2 m (6 ft 7 in) needing confirmation. This eagle&#x2019;s wingspan is quite short for the bird&#x2019;s size, being around the same mean width as that of a <span>Tawny Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila rapax</i>) or a <span>Short-toed Snake Eagle</span> (<i>Circaetus gallicus</i>), species that weigh about half as much as a Crowned Eagle. However, the somewhat boxy and rounded wings are quite broad, being broader than, for example, the much longer-winged <span>Golden Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>). The wing morphology of the species gives it maneuverability in its densely wooded environment. The <span>wing chord</span> measures 44.5-53.2 cm (17.5-20.9 in), with a median of 46.7 cm (18.4 in) in males and 51.2 cm (20.2 in) in females . While it, on average, is less heavy and has a smaller wingspan than the often sympatric <span>Martial Eagle</span>, its average total length exceeds that of the Martial Eagle thanks to its much longer tail. The Crowned Eagle&#x2019;s tail is from 30 to 41 cm (12 to 16 in) long, with a median of 31.5 cm (12.4 in) in males and 34.8 cm (13.7 in) in females. The <span>bill</span> is of a medium size relative to its body size, with one large museum specimen&#x2019;s bill measuring 5.5 cm (2.2 in) in length from the gape, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) in <span>culmen length</span> and 3.3 cm (1.3 in) in bill depth.</p>

<p>As seen in about half of the &#x201C;booted eagle&#x201D; group, the juvenile Crowned Eagle has strikingly different looking plumage compared to the adults. Much variation occurs as the maturation process occurs. A great majority of juveniles have a white head and underside, which contrast with the thighs and legs, which are heavily spotted with black. The juvenile eagle&#x2019;s back is light-brown or grayish-brown, with pale feather edgings that often give the back a scaled appearance, especially on the upper-wing coverts. There is often a pinkish red wash on the upper chest. Just-fledged chicks tend have dark patched faces, freckled bibs and slightly barred chests and spotted legs. Less common juvenile Crowned Eagle plumages, possible even when they are under a year of age and still under parental care, may include eagles so stripy that they which one could easily have aged as two to three-year olds. The tail of the juvenile is black with three pale bars and a narrow black tip. The juvenile eagle&#x2019;s cere is grey and the feet are dull-yellow. By 4 months post-fledgling, the inner thighs, previously poorly covered with downy type feathers, are covered with small feathers. While the pale 'morph' young just prior to leaving the nest usually have unmarked tarsus, they soon get spots on the front part of the tibio tarsal joint. The tibio tarsal pad is still bare and obvious up until it is a year old, whereupon it vanishes only to return to incubating females. Eye color is variable too with some having khaki light brown just prior to fledging and others with adult-like yellow ochre eyes. Up to 15 months after leaving the nest, the immature eagles more closely resemble the plumage they have at first independence than the adult&#x2019;s plumage. The juvenile may be confused with the similarly-colored juvenile Martial Eagle, especially in flight. It is distinguished from the Martial species in having a much longer, more heavily barred tail, much shorter wings and spotted thighs.</p>

<p>The Crowned Eagle inhabits mainly dense <span>woodlands</span>, including those deep within <span>rainforest</span>, but will sometimes also be found in relict patches, wooded escarpments, <span>riparian</span> strips of <i><span>Acacia</span></i>, heavily wooded hillsides, and rocky outcrops throughout its range. The Crowned Eagle may be found from an altitude of sea-level to at least 3,000 m (9,800 ft). Owing to lack of current suitable habitat, the eagle's range is often somewhat discontinuous. In the <span>Democratic Republic of the Congo</span>, the Crowned Eagle has been confirmed to survive at relatively high densities in protected areas that maintain dense, old-growth rainforests. In <span>Kenya</span>, 84% of the Crowned Eagles range in within rainforest with an annual rainfall amount of more than 150 cm (59 in). Around stretches of <span>East Africa</span> where protected areas mostly consist of fairly open habitat, Crowned Eagles usually live in wooded areas of rocky hills and narrow riverine strips, only rarely ranging into savanna surrounding the hills. <span>Southern Africa</span> has been subject to the most comprehensive study of Crowned Eagle habitat, largely since many areas there would seem inhospitable to a large raptor often associated with old-growth forest. In southern Africa, its distribution south of the <span>Limpopo River</span> coincides largely with <span>montane forest</span>, although it is not restricted to that habitat and may range secondarily into <span>plantations</span>, usually of <span>eucalyptus</span>. In South Africa, it occurs in both lowland and montane <span>evergreen forest</span>, dense woodland, and forested ravines and gorges in open <span>savannas</span> and <span>thornveld</span>. In <span>Zimbabwe</span>, the Crowned Eagle can be found in quite open woods with <i><span>Adansonia</span></i> trees and may occasionally forage in savanna and secondary growth. In <span>Malawi</span>, highland birds forage in lower <span>miombo woodland</span>, and lower altitudes, breeding occurs in deciduous forest, more locally in dense miombo, tall riparian woodlands, and in remnants close to cultivation. Crowned Eagles in <span>Zambezi</span>, occurs in evergreen forest in the eastern highlands, in rugged, hilly terrain over the central plateau, in hills and escarpments in the southeastern portions of the central watershed, and in riparian habitat along the larger rivers.</p>

using('stephanoaetus coronatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In disposition, the Crowned Eagle is considered nervous, constantly alert and on edge. They are quite different from the oft-stately open country eagles such as the <i><span>Aquila</span></i> species. In their training and management, Crowned Eagles are perhaps more reminiscent of <span>Northern goshawks</span> (<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>) than <i>Aquila</i> eagles. Some linkage has been made between forest-dwelling habits and having a curious and edgy disposition amongst various raptorial birds. Ironically considering their otherwise hyperactive behavior, the main hunting techniques of Crowned Eagle require long periods of inactivity, spent sitting on a perch. Mature Crowned Eagles are reportedly nearly fearless towards humans and, unless &#x201C;gun-shy&#x201D; from prior interactions, unusually prone to treat human aggressively. Crowned Eagles can nest around developed areas, including in the vicinity of quite suburban, developed areas (such as in view of apartment or office buildings), so long as prey is abundant and accessible and the habitat provides enough mature vegetation to facilitate nest building and hunting activities. Some biologists consider this species highly intelligent, cautious, independent and inquisitive when compared to other accipitrids. In <span>falconry</span>, Crowned Eagles cannot be induced to direct their hunting instinct towards large prey by increasing their hunger, as is done with <i>Aquila</i> eagles, for example. In the context of human interaction, wild, adult Crowned Eagles are quite the opposite of the <span>Martial Eagle</span>, which are typically very wary and tends to shun any variety of human activity. However, young Crowned Eagles in their post-fledging stage differ greatly in behavior from independent or adult eagles. Amongst post-fledging eagles in a semi-captive state, it has been noted that they border on helpless in terms of feeding and defending themselves compared to other accipitrids and are even described as &#x201C;cowardly&#x201D;, unwilling to even simulate attacking prey until many months after fledging. This implies a learning element occurs in wild Crowned Eagles during their exceptionally long post-fledging period. Crowned Eagles are reportedly variable in temperament as individuals to a degree greater than that found in most other raptors.</p>

using('stephanoaetus coronatus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Outside of the rainforest, the Crowned Eagle&#x2019;s diet tends to somewhat more diverse. While monkeys may be taken in a relatively small scale, other families, largely the <span>antelopes</span> and the <span>hyraxes</span>, become the leading prey. In some wooded hillside nests in <span>Kenya</span>, about half of the remains were from small antelope. The predominant prey species there is the <span>Suni</span> (<i>Neotragus moschatus</i>). In the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania, antelope make up about 30% of the dietary intake at nests, much of this being comprised by the Suni again. Adults of antelope of a similarly small size to the Suni, around 5 kg (11 lb) or slightly less, are readily hunted, such as <span>Kirk's dik-dik</span> (<i>Madoqua kirkii</i>) and the <span>Blue duiker</span> (<i>Philantomba monticola</i>). Larger antelopes, often weighing around 10 kg (22 lb) as adults, may be attacked (mainly calves but also an occasional adult), including <span>klipspringer</span> (<i>Oreotragus oreotragus</i>), <span>steenbok</span> (<i>Raphicerus campestris</i>), <span>Sharpe's grysbok</span> (<i>R. sharpei</i>) and about a half dozen smallish <span>duikers</span> (especially the <span>Red forest duiker</span> (<i>Cephalophus natalensis</i>)). Amongst even bigger antelope species that may be hunted, such as <span>Bushbuck</span>, <span>Thomson's gazelle</span> (<i>Eudorcas thomsonii</i>), <span>Grey rhebok</span> (<i>Pelea capreolus</i>) and <span>Impala</span> (<i>Aepyceros melampus</i>), calves are usually taken but sometimes small adult females may be hunted. The biggest duikers to have been killed weighed an estimated 20 kg (44 lb). The heaviest accurately weighed Bushbuck to be killed by a Crowned Eagle scaled 15.9 kg (35 lb), but others one killed by eagles have been larger include one around 20 kg (44 lb) and another estimated at 30 kg (66 lb), or about eight times the eagle&#x2019;s own weight. National Geographic recorded video depicting a Crowned Eagle stalking a <span>Water chevrotain</span> (<i>Hyemoschus aquaticus</i>) (the only <span>African</span> representative of a small-bodied, <span>deer</span>-like family) along a rainforest river but show the chevrotain evading the eagle by submerging and swimming away from it. Unlike primates, the taking of ungulates to a large scale is not unique to the Crowned Eagle. The Martial Eagle was reported in <span>Tsavo East National Park</span> to hunt mainly <span>dik-diks</span> and has elsewhere have exceptionally killed large duiker weighing up to 37 kg (82 lb). Even more impressive feats of ungulate-hunting have been credited to the <span>Wedge-tailed Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila audax</i>) and especially the <span>Golden Eagle</span>, despite these being considered &#x201C;less powerful&#x201D; than the Crowned Eagle. Both <i>Aquila</i> mainly take neonatal <span>lambs</span> and <span>deer</span> fawns while hunted ungulates but can attack adult sheep and other big prey (i.e. full-grown <span>kangaroos</span>, <span>emus</span>, <span>pronghorns</span>, <span>reindeer</span>, etc.). The largest prey attacked by any living raptor is probably the up to 114 kg (251 lb) <span>calves</span> killed by Golden Eagles. All four currently recognized species of hyrax have been hunted by Crowned Eagles. The greatest deal of predation for this family has been directed at <span>Southern tree hyrax</span> (<i>Dendrohyrax arboreus</i>) but, when they become locally abundant, <span>rock hyrax</span> (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) can become the number one prey item for the species.</p>

<p>Crowned Eagles have one of the most prolonged breeding cycles of any bird. It is common for raptors that live around the tropics to have a relatively elongated breeding period. Crowned Eagle pairs breed once every two years; a single breeding cycle lasts for approximately 500 days in duration. Most other eagle species complete a breeding cycle in under six months, or in about 35% of the time it takes the Crowned Eagle. While the incubation and nestling stages are about average for a tropical eagle (for example the <span>Black-breasted Snake-Eagle</span> (<i>Circaetus pectoralis</i>), about half the weight of this species, has an incubation/nestling cycle of a similar length), it is the extraordinary post-fledging period of 9-11 months that makes the Crowned Eagles&#x2019; breeding cycle so long. In <span>Harpy</span> and <span>Philippine Eagle</span>, although these are less extensively studied, it may take a similar or even longer amount of time for the young to attain full independence. A case of Crowned Eagle pairs that reportedly bred every year in South Africa are unsubstantiated but may be due to an apparently high population loss rate among juvenile eagles near areas that are heavily populated by humans. Breeding can occur almost year-around throughout the range, though egg laying seems to peak roughly around the end of the African <span>wet season</span> or the early <span>dry season</span>, from July to November. Territories or home ranges are maintained vigorously. In <span>Zimbabwe</span>, individual home ranges can vary from 140 to 200 km (54 to 77 sq mi) in size. Near the city of <span>Nelspruit</span> in South Africa, home ranges averaged 30 km (12 sq mi) in size. In southern Africa, the mean distance between active nest sites can range from 2 to 19.5 km (1.2 to 12.1 mi).</p>

<p>After hatching, the male kill rate rises to one kill every 1.5 days. Pair behavior while raising chicks is very variable, some males are very attentive to their young, while others leave virtually all brooding to the female. After 40 days of age, the young is capable of feeding itself, though is often still fed. The first feathers through the white down emerge when the Crowned Eagle chick is 40 days old, with the feathers ultimately covering the down in 76 days. After 76 days, the main feather development is in the tail or the wings. Wing-flapping begins at 45 to 50 days, increasing after around 75 days. The young fledge at 90 to 115 days, with an average 110.6 days and any period of time less than 100 days is considered unusually soon. On average, male chicks tend to be more active wing-flappers and usually will first fly around 10 days earlier than the more phlegmatic female chicks. After fledging, females are attentive 95% of the day and brood 50-75% of the day, the amount decreasing slightly with each day. The female does much of the prey capture and a majority of the nest defense after the young fledge. After fledging, the young remain in the neighborhood of the parent&#x2019;s nest and are feed every 3 to 5 days by either parent for their first 270-350 days of life. The rate of food-delivery varies from several times a day to every 3 days on average during the post-fledging period. The fledged juvenile will solicit adults (apparently even unrelated adults) for prey but does not actually take the prey unless this occurs around the nest site. The first recorded kill for a young Crowned occurred 61 days after fledging, although this is considered exceptionally early by the standards of this species. Flights increase incrementally through the post-fledging period, although the young do not engage in rising flights until they are fully independent. Independence seems triggered by the increased indifference of parents to bringing food. Due to the loud vocal interplay between the parents and the fledging eagle, the adults seem to take it as a sign that their offspring has sought independence if they return to the nesting area and hear no right auditory response. The young eagle usually remains in the care of its parents for a total of up to 11 months after it fledges, longer than is known in almost any other raptor. The advantage of this prolonged stretch to independence is that it may make for a stronger young eagle when compared to other accipitrids which have almost no post-fledging dependency period. In 34 possible cases, 18 resulted in eggs being laid. Fledging success is approximately 83% and almost all young that leave the nest also reach independence. Early estimates that it takes up to 20 years for this species to reach adulthood are, of course, erroneous and it is estimated that most Crowned Eagles will reach breeding maturity at around five years old, as is typical for large eagles.</p>

<p>Distinguishing this skua from the northern hemisphere <span>Arctic</span>, <span>Pomarine</span> and <span>long-tailed skuas</span> is relatively straightforward. The large size, massive barrel chest, and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. The flight is direct and powerful. Identification of this skua is more complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related great skua of the North Atlantic, and the other large southern hemisphere skuas. Identification problems make claims of any southern hemisphere skua in the eastern North Atlantic problematic, and few records of south polar skua have been accepted in Western <span>Europe</span>. Similar problems occur, of course, with extra-limital claims of great skua.</p>

<p>Identification is complicated by similarities to <span>long-tailed jaeger</span> and <span>pomarine skua</span>, and the existence of three colour morphs. Small for a skua, the parasitic jaeger measures 41-48 cm (16-19 in) in length, 107-125 cm (42-49 in) in wingspan and weighs 300-650 g (0.66-1.43 lb). The tail streamer of the breeding adult accounts for about 7 cm (2.8 in) of their length. Light-morph adults have a brown back, mainly white underparts and dark primary wing feathers with a white "flash". The head and neck are yellowish-white with a black cap and there is a pointed central tail projection. Dark-morph adults are dark brown, and intermediate-phase birds are dark with somewhat paler underparts, head and neck. All morphs have the white wing flash.</p>

All morphs have the white wing flash, which appears as a diagnostic double flash on the underwing. In breeding adults of all morphs, the two central tail feathers are much longer than the others, spoon-shaped, and twisted from the horizontal. Juveniles are even more problematic to identify, and are difficult to separate from Arctic skua at a distance on plumage alone.</p>

<p>With their favouring partly hidden nest sites, the provision of nestboxes has proven a dramatic conservation success, with the birds taking to them very readily.

<p>The common tern was first described by <span>Linnaeus</span> in his <i><span>Systema Naturae</span></i> in 1758 under its current scientific name, <i>Sterna hirundo</i>. The word "stearn" was used in <span>Old English</span> and a similar word was used by the <span>Frisians</span> for tern. "Stearn" appears in the poem <i><span>The Seafarer</span></i>, written around 1000 AD. Linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name <i>Sterna</i>. The Latin for <span>swallow</span> is "hirundo" and refers here to the tern's superficial likeness to that unrelated bird, which has a similar light build and long forked tail. This resemblance also leads to the informal name "sea swallow", recorded from at least the seventeenth century. The <span>Scots</span> names <i>picktarnie</i>, <i>tarrock</i> and their many variants are also believed to be <span>onomatopoeic</span>, derived from the distinctive call. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the Arctic tern.</p>

<p>The nominate subspecies of the common tern is 31-35 cm (12-14 in) long, including a 6-9 cm (2.4-3.5 in) fork in the tail, with a 77-98 cm (30-39 in) wingspan. It weighs 110-141 g (3.9-5.0 oz). Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts, very pale grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip, or all black, depending on the subspecies. The common tern's upperwings are pale grey, but as the summer wears on, the dark feather shafts of the outer <span>flight feathers</span> become exposed, and a grey wedge appears on the wings. The rump and tail are white, and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips, unlike the Arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings. There are no significant differences between the sexes. In non-breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white, the bill is all black or black with a red base, and the legs are dark red or black. The upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing, the carpal bar. Terns that have not bred successfully may start <span>moulting</span> into non-breeding adult plumage from June, but late July is more typical, with the moult suspended during migration. There is also some geographical variation, <span>Californian</span> birds often being in non-breeding plumage during migration.</p>

<p>Juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar. The crown and <span>nape</span> are brown, and the forehead is ginger, wearing to white by autumn. The upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling, and the tail lacks the adult's long outer feathers. Birds in their first post-juvenile plumage, which normally remain in their wintering areas, resemble the non-breeding adult, but have a duskier crown, dark carpal bar, and often very worn plumage. By their second year, most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults, or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead.</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>There are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the common tern. A traditionally difficult species to separate is the Arctic tern, and until the key characteristics were clarified, distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as "commic terns". Although similar in size, the two terns differ in structure and flight. The common tern has a larger head, thicker neck, longer legs, and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative, and has a more powerful, direct flight. The Arctic tern has greyer underparts than the common, which make its white cheeks more obvious, whereas the rump of the common tern can be greyish in non-breeding plumage, compared to the white of its relative. The common tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses, but the wings of Arctic stay white throughout the northern summer. All the <span>flight feathers</span> of the Arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky, only the four innermost wing feathers of the common tern share this property. The trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the Arctic tern, but thicker and less defined in the common. The bill of an adult common tern is orange-red with a black tip, except in black-billed <i>S. h. longipennis</i>, and its legs are bright red, while both features are a darker red colour in the Arctic tern, which also lacks the black bill tip.</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In the breeding areas, the roseate tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage, long, mainly black bill and very long tail feathers. The non-breeding plumage of roseate is pale above and white, sometimes pink-tinged, below. It retains the long tail streamers, and has a black bill. In flight, the roseate's heavier head and neck, long bill and faster, stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic. It feeds further out to sea than the common tern. In North America, the <span>Forster's tern</span> in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the common, with relatively short wings, a heavy head and thick bill, and long, strong legs; in all non-breeding plumages, its white head and dark eye patch make the American species unmistakable.</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Most populations of the common tern are strongly migratory, wintering south of their temperate and subarctic Northern Hemisphere breeding ranges. First summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters, although a few return to breeding colonies some time after the arrival of the adults. In North America, the common tern breeds along the Atlantic coast from <span>Labrador</span> to <span>North Carolina</span>, and inland throughout much of Canada east of the <span>Rocky Mountains</span>. In the United States, some breeding populations can also be found in the states bordering the <span>Great Lakes</span>, and locally on the <span>Gulf</span> coast. There are small, only partially migratory, colonies in the <span>Caribbean</span>; these are in The Bahamas and Cuba, and off Venezuela in the <span>Los Roques</span> and <span>Las Aves archipelagos</span>.</p>

<p>The common tern breeds across most of Europe, with the highest numbers in the north and east of the continent. There are small populations on the north African coast, and in the <span>Azores</span>, <span>Canary Islands</span> and <span>Madeira</span>. Most winter off western or southern Africa, birds from the south and west of Europe tending to stay north of the <span>equator</span> and other European birds moving further south. The breeding range continues across the temperate and <span>taiga</span> zones of Asia, with scattered outposts on the <span>Persian Gulf</span> and the coast of Iran. Small populations breed on islands off Sri Lanka, and in the <span>Ladakh</span> region of the Tibetan plateau. Western Asian birds winter in the northern <span>Indian Ocean</span>, and <i>S. h. tibetana</i> appears to be common off <span>East Africa</span> during the northern hemisphere winter. Birds from further north and east in Asia, such as <i>S. h. longipennis</i>, move through Japan, Thailand and the western <span>Pacific</span> as far as southern Australia. There are small and erratic colonies in <span>West Africa</span>, in Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, unusual in that they are within what is mainly a wintering area. Only a few common terns have been recorded in New Zealand, and this species' status in <span>Polynesia</span> is unclear. A bird <span>ringed</span> at the nest in Sweden was found dead on <span>Stewart Island</span>, New Zealand, five months later, having flown an estimated 25,000 km (15,000 mi).</p>

<p>As long distance migrants, common terns sometimes occur well outside their normal range. Stray birds have been found inland in Africa (Zambia and Malawi), and on the Maldives and Comoros islands; the nominate subspecies has reached Australia, the Andes, and the interior of South America. Asian <i>S. h. longipennis</i> has recent records from western Europe.</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, nesting from the <span>taiga</span> of Asia to tropical shores, and at altitudes up to 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in Armenia, and 4,800 m (15,700 ft) in Asia. It avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind, and also icy waters, so it does not breed as far north as the Arctic tern. The common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat, including sand or <span>shingle beaches</span>, firm dune areas, <span>salt marsh</span>, or, most commonly, islands. Flat grassland or <span>heath</span>, or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment. In mixed colonies, common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than Arctic terns, but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns; the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species. Common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts, and may even nest on flat factory roofs. Unusual nest sites include hay bales, a stump 0.6 m (2.0 ft) above the water, and floating logs or vegetation. There is a record of a common tern taking over a <span>spotted sandpiper</span> nest and laying its eggs with those of the <span>wader</span>. Outside the breeding season, all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas, and somewhere to land. In addition to natural beaches and rocks, boats, buoys and piers are often used both as perches and night-time roosts.</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2,000 <span>pairs</span>, but may occasionally number more than 20,000 pairs. Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast. Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species, such as Arctic, roseate and <span>Sandwich terns</span>, <span>black-headed gulls</span>, and <span>black skimmers</span>. Especially in the early part of the breeding season, for no known reason, most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea. This phenomenon is called a "dread".</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Like all <i>Sterna</i> terns, the common tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, from a height of 1-6 m (3.3-19.7 ft), either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers. The bird may submerge for a second or so, but to no more than 50 cm (20 in) below the surface. When seeking fish, this tern flies head-down and with its bill held vertically. It may circle or hover before diving, and then plunges directly into the water, whereas the Arctic tern favours a "stepped-hover" technique, and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height, and submerges for longer. The common tern typically forages up to 5-10 km (3.1-6.2 mi) away from the breeding colony, sometimes as far as 15 km (9.3 mi). It will follow schools of fish, and its west African migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of <span>sardines</span> off the coast of Ghana; it will also track groups of <span>predatory fish</span> or <span>dolphins</span>, waiting for their prey to be driven to the sea's surface. Terns often feed in flocks, especially if food is plentiful, and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one-third higher than for individuals.</p>

using('sterna hirundo')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The common tern preferentially hunts fish 5-15 cm (2.0-5.9 in) long. The species caught depend on what is available, but if there is a choice, terns feeding several chicks will take larger prey than those with smaller broods. The proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as 95% in some areas, but <span>invertebrate</span> prey may form a significant part of the diet elsewhere. This may include <span>worms</span>, <span>leeches</span>, <span>molluscs</span> such as small <span>squid</span>, and <span>crustaceans</span> (<span>prawns</span>, <span>shrimp</span> and <span>mole crabs</span>). In freshwater areas, large <span>insects</span> may be caught, such as <span>beetles</span>, <span>cockchafers</span> and <span>moths</span>. Adult insects may be caught in the air, and <span>larvae</span> picked from the ground or from the water surface. Prey is caught in the bill and either swallowed head-first, or carried back to the chicks. Occasionally, two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously. When adults take food back to the nest, they recognise their young by call, rather than visual identification.</p>

<p>The <b>Arctic tern</b> (<i>Sterna paradisaea</i>) is a <span>seabird</span> of the <span>tern</span> <span>family</span> <span>Sternidae</span>. This <span>bird</span> has a <span>circumpolar</span> breeding distribution covering the <span>Arctic</span> and sub-Arctic regions of <span>Europe</span>, <span>Asia</span>, and <span>North America</span> (as far south as <span>Brittany</span> and <span>Massachusetts</span>). The <span>species</span> is strongly <span>migratory</span>, seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast. Recent studies have shown average annual roundtrip lengths of about 70,900 km (c. 44,300 miles) for birds nesting in <span>Iceland</span> and <span>Greenland</span> and c. 90,000 km (c. 55,900 miles) for birds nesting in the <span>Netherlands</span>. These are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom. The Arctic tern flies as well as glides through the air, performing almost all of its tasks in the air. It nests once every one to three years (depending on its mating cycle); once it has finished nesting it takes to the sky for another long southern migration.</p>

using('sterna paradisaea')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Arctic terns are medium-sized birds. They have a length of 33-39 cm (13-15 in) and a <span>wingspan</span> of 76-85 cm (26-30 in). They are mainly grey and white plumaged, with a red beak (as long as the head, straight, with pronounced <span>gonys</span>) and feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown (streaked white), and white cheeks. The grey mantle is 305 mm, and the scapulae are fringed brown, some tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with grey outer webs. The hindcrown to the ear-coverts is black.</p>

using('sterna paradisaea')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Arctic terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching thirty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine <span>invertebrates</span>. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.</p>

using('sterna paradisaea')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Arctic tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year, the shortest distance between these areas being 19,000 km (12,000 mi). The long journey ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet. One example of this bird's remarkable long-distance flying abilities involves an Arctic tern <span>ringed</span> as an unfledged chick on the <span>Farne Islands</span>, <span>Northumberland</span>, UK, in the northern summer of 1982, which in October 1982, just three months from fledging, reached <span>Melbourne</span>, Australia. Assuming a direct route of flight, the distance covered would have been more than 22,000 km (14,000 mi). Another example is that of a chick ringed in <span>Labrador</span>, <span>Canada</span>, on 23 July 1928. It was found in South Africa four months later.</p>

<p>A 2013 tracking study of half a dozen Arctic terns breeding in the <span>Netherlands</span> shows average annual migrations of c. 90,000 km (56,000 mi). On their way south, these birds roughly followed the coastlines of <span>Europe</span> and <span>Africa</span>. Having rounded the southern tip of <span>Africa</span>, they then turned east, some flying approximately halfway to <span>Australia</span> before again turning south to eventually reach <span>Wilkes Land</span> in the north-eastern <span>Antarctic</span>. One bird flew several hundred km along the south coast of <span>Australia</span> before turning south for the <span>Antarctic</span>, while one flew along the entire south coast of <span>Australia</span>, passing between <span>Australia</span> and <span>Tasmania</span>. Having reached the <span>Melbourne</span> area, it turned south and flew in an arc to <span>Wilkes Land</span> in the north-east <span>Antarctic</span>, passing the south-western tip of <span>New Zealand</span>'s <span>South Island</span> en route. Once back in the <span>Netherlands</span>, this bird had journeyed c. 91,000 km (57,000 mi), the longest migration yet recorded for any animal.</p>

<p>While the Arctic tern is similar to the <span>common</span> and <span>roseate terns</span>, its colouring, profile, and call are slightly different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.</p>

<p>They are monogamous, territorial nesters. Males display by flapping up a steep gradient before spiraling down with wings and tail spread out. From a perch or on the ground the male will engage in a bowing display, synchronized with a rolling crooning, &#x201C;<i>uk-carrroooo</i>, ...&#x201D;, while the throat is inflated. A pair will give a double <i>coo</i> with a long second syllable when selecting a nest site. The female takes two to three days to construct the flimsy, platform nest. It is made of twigs and leaf petioles that are carefully selected by the male (as in other dove species), and delivered to her at the nest site. The nest is placed 2 to 10 meters above ground, on a horizontal branch fork. Quite often an old nest of another species may be used. Two to four pure white eggs are laid, and both sexes participate in the incubation that takes around two weeks. Chicks are fed <span>regurgitated food</span> by both parents and fledge after about 16 days. Several broods (up to 5) may be raised in a season.</p>

It lives mainly in forest and woodland though it sometimes inhabits plantations. It eats mostly insects but will also eat reptiles, small mammals, and other birds. It breeds from July to October and lays 1 to 3 eggs in a hollow in a tree. It will then incubate the eggs for about 31 days. Five weeks after the eggs hatch, the young will leave the nest and can fly 2 weeks later. The young will remain with the parents for about four months and will sometimes stay until the next breeding season. Its call is a loud series of fast hoots.

It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs, and can run at up to about 70 km/h (43 mph), the fastest land speed of any bird. The ostrich is the <span>largest living species</span> of <span>bird</span> and lays the largest eggs of any living bird (extinct <span>elephant birds</span> of Madagascar and the <span>giant moa</span> of New Zealand laid larger eggs).</p>

<p>The long neck and legs keep their head up to 2.8 m (9 ft) above the ground, and their eyes are said to be the largest of any land vertebrate: 50 mm (2.0 in) in diameter; they can therefore perceive predators at a great distance.

Unlike all other living birds, the ostrich secretes urine separately from faeces. All other birds store the urine and faeces combined in the <span>coprodeum</span>, but the ostrich stores the faeces in the terminal rectum. They also have unique <span>pubic bones</span> that are fused to hold their gut. Unlike most birds, the males have a copulatory organ, which is retractable and 8 in (20 cm) long.

<p>The population from <span>R&#xED;o de Oro</span> was once separated as <i>Struthio camelus spatzi</i> because its eggshell pores were shaped like a teardrop and not round. However, as there is considerable variation of this character and there were no other differences between these birds and adjacent populations of <i>S. c. camelus</i>, the separation is no longer considered valid. This population disappeared in the latter half of the 20th century. There were 19th-century reports of the existence of small ostriches in North Africa; these are referred to as Levaillant's ostrich (<i>Struthio bidactylus</i>) but remain a hypothetical form not supported by material evidence.</p>

<p>The female ostrich lays her fertilised <span>eggs</span> in a single communal nest, a simple pit, 30-60 cm (12-24 in) deep and 3 m (9.8 ft) wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first, and when it is time to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird &#x2014; on average they are 15 cm (5.9 in) long, 13 cm (5.1 in) wide, and weigh 1.4 kilograms (3.1 lb), over 20 times the weight of a <span>chicken</span>'s egg and only 1 to 4% the size of the female. They are glossy cream-coloured, with thick shells marked by small pits. The eggs are incubated by the females by day and by the males by night. This uses the colouration of the two sexes to escape detection of the nest, as the drab female blends in with the sand, while the black male is nearly undetectable in the night. The <span>incubation</span> period is 35 to 45 days, which is rather short compared to other <span>ratites</span>. This is believed to be the case due to the high rate of predation. Typically, the male defends the hatchlings and teaches them to feed, although males and females cooperate in rearing chicks. Fewer than 10% of nests survive the 9 week period of laying and incubation, and of the surviving chicks, only 15% of those survive to 1 year of age. However, among those ostriches who survive to adulthood, the species is one of the longest-living bird species. Ostriches in captivity have lived to 62 years and 7 months.</p>

<p>Ostriches develop via <span>Intussusceptive angiogenesis</span>, a mechanism of <span>blood vessel</span> formation, characterizing many organs. It is not only involved in vasculature expansion, but also in angioadaptation of vessels to meet physiological requirements. The use of such mechanisms demonstrates an increase in the later stages of <span>lung</span> development, along with elaborate parabronchial <span>vasculature</span>, and reorientation of the <span>gas exchange</span> blood capillaries to establish the crosscurrent system at the blood-gas barrier. The <span>blood-gas barrier</span> (BGB) of their lung tissue is thick. The advantage of this thick barrier may be protection from damage by large volumes of blood flow in times of activity, such as running, since air is pumped by the air sacs rather than the lung itself. As a result the <span>capillaries</span> in the parabronchi have thinner walls, permitting more efficient gaseous exchange. In combination with separate pulmonary and systemic circulatory systems, it helps to reduce stress on the BGB.</p>

<p>The <span>coronary</span> <span>arteries</span> start in the right and left aortic sinus and provide blood to the heart muscle in a similar fashion to most other vertebrates. Other domestic birds capable of flight have three or more <span>coronary</span> arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The blood supply by the coronary arteries are fashioned starting as a large branch over the surface of the heart. It then moves along the <span>coronary groove</span> and continues on into the tissue as <span>interventricular</span> branches toward the <span>apex</span> of the heart. The <span>atria</span>, <span>ventricles</span>, and <span>septum</span> are supplied of blood by this modality. The deep branches of the coronary arteries found with in the heart tissue are small and supply the interventricular and right <span>atrioventricular</span> valve with blood nutrients for which to carry out their processes. The interatrial artery of the ostrich is small in size and exclusively supplies blood to only part of the left auricle and interatrial <span>septum</span>.</p>

<p>The ostrich is well adapted to hot, arid environments through specialization of <span>excretory</span> organs. The ostrich has an extremely long and developed <span>colon</span> the length of approximately 11-13m between the <span>coprodeum</span> and the paired <span>caeca</span>, which are around 80 cm long. A well developed caeca is also found and in combination with the <span>rectum</span> forms the <span>microbial fermentation</span> chambers used for <span>carbohydrate</span> breakdown. The <span>catabolism</span> of carbohydrates produces ~ 0.56 g of water that can be used internally. The majority of their <span>urine</span> is stored in the coprodeum, and the <span>faeces</span> are separately stored in the terminal colon. The coprodeum is located ventral to the terminal rectum and urodeum (where the <span>ureters</span> open). Found between the terminal rectum and coprodeum is a strong sphincter. The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma <span>aldosterone</span>, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of <span>hyperosmotic</span> urine; cloacal urine has been found to be 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where urine is stored) from plasma across the <span>epithelium</span> is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick <span>mucosal</span> layering of the coprodeum.</p>

The <span>ureters</span> leave the ventral caudomedial surface and continue caudally, near the midline into the opening of the urodeum of the cloaca. Although there is no bladder, a dilated pouch of ureter stores the urine until it is secreted continuously down from the <span>ureters</span> to the urodeum until discharged.</p>

<p>Ostrich kidneys are fairly large, and so are able to hold significant amounts of <span>solutes</span>. Hence, ostriches drink relatively large volumes of water daily, and <span>excrete</span> generous quantities of highly concentrated <span>urine</span>. It is when drinking water is unavailable or withdrawn, that the urine becomes highly concentrated with <span>uric acid and urates</span>. It seems that ostriches who normally drink relatively large amounts of water tend to rely on <span>renal conservation</span> of water when drinking water is scarce within the kidney system. Though there have been no official detailed <span>renal studies</span> conducted on the <span>flow rate</span> (<span>Poiseuille's Law</span>) and composition of the ureteral urine in the ostrich, knowledge of <span>renal function</span> has been based on samples of <span>cloacal urine</span>, and samples or quantitative collections of <span>voided urine</span>. Studies have shown that the amount of water intake, and <span>dehydration</span> impacts the <span>plasma osmolality</span> and <span>urine osmolality</span> within various sized ostriches. During a normal hydration state of the kidneys, young ostriches tend to have a measured plasma osmolality of 284 <span>mOsm</span>, and urine osmolality of 62 mOsm. Adults have higher rates with a plasma osmolality of 330 mOsm, and a urine osmolality of 163 mOsm. The <span>osmolality</span> of both plasma and urine can alter in regards to whether there is an excess or depleted amount of water present within the kidneys. An interesting fact of ostriches is that when water is freely available, the <span>urine osmolality</span> can reduce to 60-70 <span>mOsm</span>, not losing any necessary solutes from the kidneys when excess water is excreted. Dehydrated or salt-loaded ostriches can reach a maximal <span>urine osmolality</span> of approximately 800 mOsm. When the plasma osmolality has been measured simultaneously with the maximal osmotic urine, it is seen that the urine:plasma ratio is 2.6:1, the highest encountered among <span>avian species</span>. Along with dehydration, there is also a reduction in <span>flow rate</span> from 20 L/day to only a mere 0.3-0.5 L/day.</p>

<p>A number of avian species use <span>nasal salt glands</span>, alongside their kidneys, to control <span>hypertonicity</span> in their <span>blood plasma</span>. However, the ostrich shows no nasal glandular function in regard to this homeostatic process. Even in a state of dehydration, which increases the <span>osmolality</span> of the blood, nasal salt glands show no sizeable contribution of salt elimination. Also, the overall mass of the glands was less than that of the duck&#x2019;s nasal gland. The ostrich, having a heavier body weight, should have larger, heavier nasal glands to more effectively excrete salt from a larger volume of blood, but this is not the case. These unequal proportions contribute to the assumption that the ostrich&#x2019;s nasal glands do not play any role in salt excretion. The nasal glands may be the result of an ancestral trait, which is no longer needed by the ostrich, but has not been bred out of their gene pool.</p>

<p>At low ambient temperatures the ostrich utilizes feather flattening, which conserves body heat through insulation. The low <span>conductance coefficient</span> of air allows less heat to be lost to the environment. This flattening behavior compensate for ostrich's rather poor cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL). These feather heavy areas such as the body, thighs and wings do not usually vary much from ambient temperatures due to this behavioural controls. This ostrich will also cover its legs to reduce heat loss to the environment, along with undergoing <span>piloerection</span> and <span>shivering</span> when faced with low ambient temperatures.</p>

using('struthio camelus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The use of <span>countercurrent</span> heat exchange with blood flow allows for regulated conservation/ elimination of heat of appendages. When ambient temperatures are low, <span>heterotherms</span> will constrict their arterioles to reduce heat loss along skin surfaces.

using('struthio camelus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In hot temperatures water is lost via respiration. Moreover, varying surface temperatures within the respiratory tract contribute differently to overall heat and water loss through panting.

<p>Along with BMR, energy is also needed for a range of other activities. If the <span>ambient temperature</span> is lower than the <span>thermo-neutral zone</span>, heat is produced to maintain <span>body temperature</span>. So, the metabolic rate in a resting, unfed bird, that is producing heat is known as the <span>standard metabolic rate (SMR)</span> or <span>resting metabolic rate(RMR)</span>. The ostrich SMR has been seen to be approximately 0.26 ml O<sub>2</sub> g h, almost 2.3 times the BMR. On another note, animals that engage in extensive physical activity employ substantial amounts of energy for power. This is known as the maximum <span>metabolic scope</span>. In an ostrich, it is seen to be at least 28 times greater than the BMR. Likewise, the daily energy <span>turnover rate</span> for an ostrich with access to free water is 12,700 kJ day, equivalent to 0.26 ml O<sub>2</sub> g h.</p>

<p>Ostriches typically avoid humans in the wild, since they correctly assess humans as potential predators. If approached, they often run away, but sometimes ostriches can be very aggressive when threatened, especially if cornered, and may also attack if they feel the need to defend their territories or offspring. Similar behaviors are noted in captive or domesticated ostriches, which retain the same natural instincts and can occasionally respond aggressively to stress. When attacking a person, ostriches deliver slashing kicks with their powerful feet, armed with long claws, with which they can <span>disembowel</span> or kill a person with a single blow. In one study of ostrich attacks, it was estimated that two to three attacks that result in serious injury or death occur each year in the area of <span>Oudtshoorn</span>, <span>South Africa</span>, where a large number of ostrich farms are set next to both feral and wild ostrich populations.</p>

It is about 20 cm (8 in) long and has glossy black <span>plumage</span>, which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults.

<p>The common starling is 19-23 cm (7.5-9.1 in) long, with a wingspan of 31-44 cm (12-17 in) and a weight of 58-101 g (2.0-3.6 oz). Among standard measurements, the <span>wing chord</span> is 11.8 to 13.8 cm (4.6 to 5.4 in), the <span>tail</span> is 5.8 to 6.8 cm (2.3 to 2.7 in), the <span>culmen</span> is 2.5 to 3.2 cm (0.98 to 1.26 in) and the <span>tarsus</span> is 2.7 to 3.2 cm (1.1 to 1.3 in). The <span>plumage</span> is <span>iridescent</span> black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. <span>Moulting</span> occurs once a year, in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an <span>iris</span> and the central always-dark <span>pupil</span> is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered.</p>

<p>Several terrestrial starlings, including those in the <span>genus</span> <i><span>Sturnus</span></i>, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the <span>Spotless</span> and <span>white-cheeked starlings</span>), where the <span>protractor muscles</span> responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items.

<p>Males sing constantly as the breeding period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In the presence of a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater <span>reproductive success</span> than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.</p>

using('sturnus vulgaris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Unpaired males find a suitable cavity and begin to build nests in order to attract single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of <span>herbs</span> in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as <span>yarrow</span> acts as an <span>olfactory</span> attractant to females.</p>

using('sturnus vulgaris')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p><span>Incubation</span> lasts thirteen days, although the last egg laid may take 24 hours longer than the first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, and is the only parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. <span>Nestlings</span> remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. <span>Fledglings</span> continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' <span>faecal sacs</span> are removed by the adults.</p>

<p><span>Intraspecific</span> <span>brood parasites</span> are common in common starling nests. Female "floaters" (unpaired females during the breeding season) present in colonies often lay eggs in another pair's nest. Fledglings have also been reported to invade their own or neighbouring nests and evict a new brood. Common starling nests have a 48% to 79% rate of successful fledging, although only 20% of nestlings survive to breeding age; the adult survival rate is closer to 60%. The average life span is about 2-3 years, with a longevity record of 22 yr 11 m.</p>

<p>Because of the damage they do, there have been attempts to control the numbers of both native and introduced populations of common starlings. Within the natural breeding range, this may be affected by legislation. For example, in Spain, this is a species hunted commercially as a food item, and has a close season, whereas in France, it is classed as a pest, and the season in which it may be killed covers the greater part of the year. In the UK, the common starling may be killed at any time of year. This species is migratory, so birds involved in control measures may have come from a wide area and breeding populations may not be greatly impacted. In Europe, the varying legislation and mobile populations mean that control attempts may have limited long-term results. Non-lethal techniques such as scaring with <span>visual or auditory devices</span> have only a temporary effect in any case.</p>

<p>The meerkat is a small <span>diurnal</span> herpestid (<span>mongoose</span>) weighing on average about 731 grams (1.612 lb) for males and 720 grams (1.59 lb) for females. Its long slender body and limbs give it a body length of 25 to 35 centimetres (9.8 to 13.8 in) and an added tail length of 17 to 25 centimetres (6.7 to 9.8 in). Its tail is not bushy like all other mongoose species, but is rather long and thin and tapers to a black or reddish colored pointed tip. The meerkat uses its tail to balance when standing upright, as well as for signaling. Its face tapers, coming to a point at the nose, which is brown. The eyes always have black patches around them, and they have small black crescent-shaped ears that can close to exclude soil when digging. Like cats, meerkats have <span>binocular vision</span>, a large peripheral range, depth perception, and eyes on the front of their faces.</p>

Claws are also used with muscular hindlegs to help climb trees. Meerkats have four toes on each foot and long slender limbs. The coat is usually fawn-colored peppered with gray, tan, or brown with a silver tint. They have short parallel stripes across their backs, extending from the base of the tail to the shoulders. The patterns of stripes are unique to each meerkat. The underside of the meerkat has no markings, but the belly has a patch which is only sparsely covered with hair and shows the black skin underneath.

The weight is typically 16-25 g (0.6-0.9 oz), but can be up to 31 g (1.1 oz) for birds preparing to migrate. The adult male has olive-grey upperparts, other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head. The underparts are light grey, becoming silvery white on the chin, throat and upper breast. The tail is dark grey, with an olive tint to the outer edge of each feather. The bill and long legs are grey, and the <span>iris</span> is reddish-brown. The female resembles the male, but has a reddish-brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts. Juveniles are similar to the female, but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge, and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts. This species is unmistakable; other dark-headed <i>Sylvia</i> species, such <span>Sardinian</span> and <span>Orphean warblers</span> have extensive black on the head instead of a small cap.

<p>There is a migratory divide in Europe at <span>longitude</span> 10-11&#xB0;E. Birds to the west of this line head southwest towards Iberia or West Africa, whereas populations to the east migrate to the eastern Mediterranean and on to East Africa. Cross-breeding in captivity of birds from the resident population on the Canary Islands with migratory blackcaps from Germany showed the urge to migrate is genetically controlled, the offspring showing intermediate behaviour in terms of restlessness at migration time. Similar experiments using birds from southern Germany and eastern Austria, on opposite sides of the migratory divide, demonstrated that the direction of migration is also genetically determined. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.</p>

Other habitats, such as parks, large gardens and overgrown hedges, are used as long as they meet the essential requirements of tall trees for songposts and an established <span>understory</span>. Where other <i>Sylvia</i> warblers also breed, blackcaps tend to use taller trees than their relatives, preferably those with a good canopy, such as <span>pedunculate oak</span>. In prime habitat, breeding densities reach 100-200 pairs per square kilometre (250-500 pairs per square mile) in northern Europe, and 500-900 pairs per square kilometre (1,250-2,250 pairs per square mile) in Italy. Densities are much lower in poorer habitats such as conifer forests. Breeding occurs in Europe at altitudes up to 2,200 m (7,200 ft).</p>

<p>The <b>garden warbler</b> (<i>Sylvia borin</i>) is a common and widespread small <span>bird</span> that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed <span>typical warbler</span> with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults. Its two <span>subspecies</span> differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused with a number of other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler's rich melodic song is similar to that of the <span>blackcap</span>, its closest relative, which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland.</p>

using('sylvia borin')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The garden warbler is 14 cm (5.5 in) long with a 7.6-8.4 cm (3.0-3.3 in) wing length. The weight is typically 16-22 g (0.6-0.8 oz), but can be up to 35.5 g (1.25 oz) for birds preparing to migrate. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed bird with unstreaked olive-brown upperparts and dull white underparts. It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale <span>supercilium</span>, and there is a buff wash to the throat and flanks. The eye is black, the legs are bluish-grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower <span>mandible</span>. The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size. Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult, with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts. The eastern subspecies <i>S. b. woodwardi</i> is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts. The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa, but a wing length greater than 80 mm (3.15 in) confirms <i>S. b. woodwardi</i> when birds are trapped.</p>

using('sylvia borin')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The plain appearance of the garden warbler means that it can be confused with several other species. The <span>melodious</span> and <span>icterine warblers</span> usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The <span>booted warbler</span> is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. <span>western</span> and <span>eastern olivaceous warblers</span> are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile <span>barred warblers</span>, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.</p>

using('sylvia borin')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The male's song, usually delivered by birds in dense cover, is a rich musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration, but sometimes for longer periods. The song is confusable with that of the blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp <i>kek-kek</i>, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping <i>tchurr-r-r-r</i> resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard. The juvenile has a <i>quia</i> alarm vocalisation. The garden warbler will occasionally mimic other birds, and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap. Both <i>Sylvia</i> warblers will also sing against <span>common nightingales</span>, which have a similar song despite being unrelated. Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.</p>

using('sylvia borin')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The first eggs are laid in late April in southern Germany, early May in northwest Europe, and late May in Finland. The season is prolonged with some birds nesting as late as July. The <span>clutch</span> is typically four or five eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish or buff with grey, purple and brown blotches. The average size of the egg is 20 x 15 mm (0.78 x 0.59 in), and it weighs 2.2 g (0.08 oz), of which 6% is shell. The eggs are <span>incubated</span> for 11-12 days by both adults, although only the female stays on the nest at night. The chicks are <span>altricial</span>, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They <span>fledge</span> about 10 days after hatching (range 9-12), leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly. They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks, and the family may stay together for a few days after that. The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure, the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible, even while still flightless. This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood, but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves. One brood per year is normal, although a few second broods are known.</p>

<p>There has been a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, although the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps and juvenile (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.</p>

using('sylvia borin')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In his <i><span>History of Animals</span></i>, <span>Aristotle</span> considered that the garden warbler eventually <span>metamorphosed</span> into a blackcap. The composer <span>Olivier Messiaen</span> used the song of the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece <i><span>La fauvette des jardins</span></i>, the title being the French name of the species. His <span>Turangal&#xEE;la-Symphonie</span>, a major work inspired by the legend of <span>Tristan and Iseult</span>, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features the song of the warbler, along with the those of the nightingale and <span>blackbird</span>.</p>

As long as they have vegetation to eat (from which they get some water), they can go without drinking for very long periods. In the rainy season, they will frequently not drink water at all, instead obtaining fluids from fruits.

using('sylvietta rufescens')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Long-billed Crombec's nest is a large, hanging bag of grasses, spider webs, and plant fibres, which is attached to the lower limbs of a tree, often an <i>Acacia</i>.

<p>The African buffalo is a very robust species. Its shoulder height can range from 1 to 1.7 m (3.3 to 5.6 ft) and its head-and-body length can range from 1.7 to 3.4 m (5.6 to 11.2 ft). Compared with other <span>large bovids</span>, it has a long but stocky body (the body length can exceed the <span>wild water buffalo</span>, which is rather heavier and taller) and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. The tail can range from 70 to 110 cm (28 to 43 in) long. <span>Savannah</span>-type buffaloes weigh 500 to 900 kg (1,100 to 2,000 lb), with males normally larger than females, reaching the upper weight range. In comparison, <span>forest-type buffaloes</span>, at 250 to 450 kg (600 to 1,000 lb), are only half that size. Its head is carried low; its top is located below the backline. The front hooves of the buffalo are wider than the rear, which is associated with the need to support the weight of the front part of the body, which is heavier and more powerful than the back.</p>

using('syncerus caffer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The African buffalo is one of the most successful grazers in Africa. It lives in <span>swamps</span> and floodplains, as well as <span>mopane</span> <span>grasslands</span> and forests of the major mountains of Africa. This buffalo prefers habitat with dense cover, such as reeds and thickets, but can also be found in open woodland. While not particularly demanding with regard to habitat, they require water daily, so depend on perennial sources of water. Like the <span>plains zebra</span>, the buffalo can live on tall, coarse grasses. Herds of buffalo mow down grasses and make way for more selective grazers. When feeding, the buffalo makes use of its tongue and wide <span>incisor</span> row to eat grass more quickly than most other African herbivores. Buffaloes do not stay on trampled or depleted areas for long.</p>

using('syncerus caffer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Cape buffalo is susceptible to many diseases, including <span>bovine tuberculosis</span>, corridor disease, and <span>foot and mouth disease</span>. As with many diseases, these problems will remain dormant within a population as long as the health of the animals is good. These diseases do, however, restrict the legal movements of the animals and fencing infected areas from unaffected areas is enforced. Some wardens and game managers have managed to protect and breed &#x201C;disease-free&#x201D; herds which become very valuable because they can be transported. Most well-known are <span>Lindsay Hunt</span>&#x2019;s efforts to source uninfected animals from the <span>Kruger National Park</span> in <span>South Africa</span>. Some disease-free buffaloes in South Africa have been sold to breeders for close to US$130,000.<br clear="all"/></p>

using('syncerus caffer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p><span>Herd size</span> is highly variable. The core of the herds is made up of related females, and their offspring, in an almost linear <span>dominance hierarchy</span>. The basic herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males, high-ranking males and females and old or invalid animals. The young males keep their distance from the dominant bull, who is recognizable by the thickness of his horns. During the dry season, males will split from the herd and form bachelor groups. Two types of bachelor herds occur: ones made of males aged four to seven years and those of males 12 years or older. During the wet season, the younger bulls rejoin a herd to mate with the females. They stay with them throughout the season to protect the calves. Some older bulls cease to rejoin the herd, as they can no longer compete with the younger, more aggressive males. Males have a linear dominance hierarchy based on age and size. Since a buffalo is safer when a herd is larger, dominant bulls may rely on subordinate bulls and sometimes tolerate their copulation.</p>

using('syncerus caffer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>African buffaloes make various vocalizations. Many calls are lower-pitched versions of those emitted by <span>domestic cattle</span>. They emit low-pitched, two- to four-second calls intermittently at three- to six-second intervals to signal the herd to move. To signal to the herd to change direction, leaders will emit &#x201C;gritty&#x201D;, &#x201C;creaking gate&#x201D; sounds. When moving to drinking places, some individuals make long <i>maaa</i> calls up to 20 times a minute. When being aggressive, they make explosive grunts that may last long or turn into rumbling growl. Cows produce croaking calls when looking for their calves. Calves will make a similar call of a higher pitch when in distress. When threatened by predators, they make drawn-out <i>waaaa</i> calls. Dominant individuals make calls to announce their presence and location. A more intense version of the same call is emitted as a warning to an encroaching inferior. When grazing, they will make various sounds, such as brief bellows, grunts, honks and croaks.</p>

using('syncerus caffer')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Cows first calve at five years of age, after a <span>gestation</span> period of 11.5 months. Newborn calves remain hidden in vegetation for the first few weeks while being nursed occasionally by the mother before joining the main herd. Older calves are held in the centre of the herd for safety.  The maternal bond between mother and calf lasts longer than in most bovids. However, when a new calf is born, the bonding ends and the mother will keep her previous offspring at bay with horn jabs. Nevertheless, the yearling will follow its mother for another year or so. Males leave their mothers when they are two years old and join the bachelor groups. Young calves, unusually for bovids, suckle from behind their mothers, pushing their heads between the mothers' legs.</p>

<p>The buffalo is listed as <span>Least Concern</span> by the <span>IUCN</span> &#x201C;as the species remains widespread, with a global population estimated at nearly 900,000 animals, of which more than three-quarters are in protected areas. While some populations (subspecies) are decreasing, others will remain unchanged in the long term if large, healthy populations continue to persist in a substantial number of national parks, equivalent reserves and hunting zones in southern and eastern Africa&#x201D;.</p>

Their flight is slower and more powerful than that of their smaller relative, with a call that is a drawn-out twittering (listen at right).</p>

using('tadorna cana')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This is a 64 cm long bird which breeds in southern <span>Africa</span>, mainly in <span>Namibia</span> and <span>South Africa</span>. In the southern winter, many birds move north-east from the breeding range to favoured moulting grounds, where sizable concentrations occur.</p>

using('taphozous mauritianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The Mauritian tomb bat is distinguished from other species of bat by a completely white ventral area. The dorsal surface of <i>T. mauritianus</i> is a mottled color consisting of several shades of brown, gray, and white, which creates a grizzled "salt and pepper" appearance. Its fur is sleek and short, and the wing <span>membranes</span> are beige and primarily <span>translucent</span>. The wings are long, narrow, and shorten when not in flight in a way that facilitates crawling, a trait unique to this genus. Sexes are similar in color and size. Adults are generally lighter in color than <span>juveniles</span>, who have more of a gray hue. This species has a conically shaped face, which is covered in a thin layer of hair. The area below and in front of the eyes is bare, and the frontal portion of the face is sunken around the eyes. The eyes are large (2-3 mm). The ears are triangular-shaped, erect, and have rounded edges. The inner margins of the ear lack papillae, which is the inner sensory surface of the bat's ear. One of the larger species in the <span>Microchiroptera</span> suborder, fully grown adults weigh anywhere from 25 to 36 grams, with its forearm measuring 58 to 64 millimeters. The total length is from 100 to 110 millimeters.</p>

using('taphozous mauritianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>They usually roost with their <span>ventral</span> side flat against a surface. The Mauritian tomb bat is nocturnal and rests during the day; however, it does not sleep much and remains watchful while roosting. If disturbed, they will fly off to another site or move quickly up under the eaves of the building. Very rarely do they travel far from their day roosting site, and roosts are often recolonized. Over time these sites become stained with gular sack secretions and urine. The stains are typically a rectangular brown shape roughly 150 mm long and 100 mm wide.</p>

using('taphozous mauritianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Their preferred food is <span>moths</span>, though during daylight hours they will prey upon <span>butterflies</span> and <span>termites</span>. In regions where the bats live, they often are a factor in keeping pest populations down. This is important since the bats inhabit areas often plagued by insect-borne diseases such as <span>malaria</span>. They usually wait for complete darkness before foraging. Over open areas, they can detect their prey at long ranges. They periodically make dives when hunting, and with each dive, they increase the rate of echolocation.</p>

using('taphozous mauritianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>When it is dark, they use <span>echolocation</span> calls to <span>forage</span>. During daylight hours, they can rely on vision to look for prey and intruders. The echolocation in <i>T. mauritianus</i> is unique in that their <span>frequency</span> pulses are emitted in patterns of twos and threes separated by long intervals of silence. This helps observers distinguish the species from other kinds of bats. The bats can adjust the frequency they emit to fit a given situation. For example, the bat can decrease the frequency to less than 20 <span>Hertz</span> to hunt insects that are attuned to bat echolocation, which gives them an advantage and increases their number of potential food sources. They are capable of emitting frequencies more than 25 Hertz, which allows them to hunt in less open habitats. This increases their range of habitats, and allows them to be flexible in their choice of environments.</p>

<p>The giant eland is also called "Lord Derby's eland" in honour of <span>Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby</span>. It was due to his efforts that the giant eland was first introduced to England between 1835 and 1851. Lord Derby sent botanist <span>Joseph Burke</span> to collect animals, either alive or dead, from South Africa for his museum and <span>menagerie</span>. The first elands introduced in England were a pair of common elands, and what would later be identified as a giant eland bull. The details were recorded in Smith-Stanley's privately printed work, <i>Cleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley Hall</i>. The Latin name indicates that it "belonged to" (given by the suffix -<i>anus</i>) Derby, hence <i>derbianus</i>.</p>

<p>Giant eland is placed in the genus <i><span>Taurotragus</span></i> of family <span>Bovidae</span>. Giant elands are sometimes considered part of the genus <i><span>Tragelaphus</span></i> on the basis of <span>molecular phylogenetics</span>, but are usually categorized as <i>Taurotragus</i>, along with the <span>common eland</span> (<i>T. oryx</i>). Giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the <span>tribe</span> <i>Tragelaphini</i> to be given a generic name other than <i>Tragelaphus</i>. Although some authors, like <span>Theodor Haltenorth</span>, regarded the giant eland as <span>conspecific</span> with the common eland, they are usually considered two distinct species.</p>

using('taurotragus derbianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>The giant elands are spiral-horned antelopes. Despite its common name, this species broadly overlaps in size with the common eland (<i>Taurotragus oryx</i>). The giant eland is the largest species of <span>antelope</span> in the world. They are typically between 220 and 290 cm (7.2 and 9.5 ft) in head-and-body length and stand approximately 130 to 180 cm (4.3 to 5.9 ft) at the shoulder. Giant elands exhibit <span>sexual dimorphism</span>, as males are larger than females. The males weigh 400 to 1,000 kg (880 to 2,200 lb) and females weigh 300 to 600 kg (660 to 1,320 lb). The tail is long, having a dark tuft of hair, and averages 90 cm (35 in) in length. The life expectancy of giant elands is up to 25 years in the wild, and about 20 years in captivity.</p>

using('taurotragus derbianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>A crest of short black hair extends down the neck to the middle of the back, and is particularly prominent on the shoulders. The slender legs are slightly lighter on their inner surfaces, with black and white markings just above the <span>hooves</span>. There are large black spots on the upper forelegs. The bridge of the nose is charcoal black, and there is a thin, indistinct <span>tan</span>-coloured line, which is the chevron, between the eyes. The lips are white, as are several dots along the jawline. A pendulous <span>dewlap</span>, larger in males than females, originates from between the jowls and hangs to the upper chest when they reach <span>sexual maturity</span>, with a fringe of hair on its edge. The large ears of the giant eland serve as signaling devices. Giant elands have comparatively longer legs than the common eland, as well as much brighter black and white markings on the legs and <span>pasterns</span>.</p>

using('taurotragus derbianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Both sexes have tightly spiraled, 'V'-shaped <span>horns</span>. They can be up to 123 cm (4.04 ft) long on males and 66 cm (2.17 ft) on females. Males have horns that are thicker at the ends, longer, and more divergent than those of females. These features of the horns suggest that the giant eland evolved from an ancestor with true <span>display</span> horns.</p>

<p>Previous genetic studies of African savanna <span>ungulates</span> revealed the presence of a long-standing <span>Pleistocene</span> refugium in east and South Africa, which also includes the giant eland.

using('taurotragus derbianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Primarily a herbivore, the giant eland eats grasses and foliage, as well as other parts of a plant. In the rainy season, they browse in herds and feed on grasses. They can eat coarse, dry grass and weeds if nothing else is available. They eat fruits too, such as plums. A study in South Africa showed that an eland's diet consists of 75% shrubs and 25% grasses, with highly varying proportions. They often use their long horns to break off branches.</p>

using('taurotragus derbianus')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks in the wet season. Females reach sexual maturity at about two years, and males at four to five years. A female can remain in <span>estrus</span> for three days, and the estrous cycle is 21-26 days long. As in all antelopes, mating occurs at a time of food abundance. In some areas distinct breeding seasons exist. In southern Africa, females have been seen giving birth from August to October, and are joined by the males from late October to January. In <span>Zambia</span> calves are born in July and August.</p>

<p>A study of the long-term conservation strategy of the western giant eland was done in the Bandia and Fathala reserves, using demographic and pedigree data based on continuous monitoring of reproduction during 2000 to 2009. In 2009, the semi-captive population was 54 individuals (26 males, 28 females). The female breeding probability was 84%, and the annual population growth was 1.36. With more population, the elands were divided into five groups for observation. Although the mean interbreeding level became 0.119, a potential <span>gene diversity</span> (GD) of 92% was retained. The authors concluded that with the introduction of new <span>founders</span>, the GD could be greatly improved in the next 100 years, and suggested that with proper management of the semi-captive population, the numbers of the western giant eland could be increased.</p>

<p>Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the greater crested tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large prawn trawl fishery. Conversely, <span>purse-seine</span> fishing reduces the available food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of great crested terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by purse-seine fishing. Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked by <span>longline fishing</span>, but, unlike <span>albatrosses</span> and <span>petrels</span>, there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected.</p>

One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11-14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and there is no throat beard. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A <span>chevron</span> is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches and two white spots appear on each side of the lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu's. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.</p>

<p>Horns are present only on males. The spiral horns are 50-70 cm (20-28 in) long, and have two to two-and-a-half twists. The base circumference is 156-171 cm (61-67 in). The slender horns are dark brown and tipped with white. Male young begin developing horns after six to eight months, which reach full length after three years.</p>

<p>The lesser kudu is gregarious in nature. There is no distinct leader or any hierarchy in the social structure. There is no territorial behaviour and fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudu will interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females along with their offspring may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year-and-a-half, and may form pairs. However, at the age of four to five years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoiding one another, though four to five bulls may share the same home range. Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.</p>

<p>The lesser kudu inhabits dry, flat and heavily forested regions. It is closely associated with <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Commiphora</i> thornbush in semi-arid areas of northeastern Africa. The animal avoids open areas and long grass, preferring shaded areas with short grasses instead. Found in woodlands and hilly areas as well, the lesser kudu is generally found at altitudes below 1,200 m (3,900 ft); though they have been recorded at heights of about 1,740 m (5,710 ft) near <span>Mount Kilimanjaro</span>. While individual home ranges of these animals are 0.4-6.7 <span>km</span> (4,300,000-72,000,000 sq ft) in size, those of males have an average size of 2.2 <span>km</span> (24,000,000 sq ft) and those of females 1.8 <span>km</span> (19,000,000 sq ft).</p>

using('turdoides bicolor')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Cooperative behaviours include: provisioning young (both in the nest and post-fledging), sentinel behaviour, territory border defense, teaching behaviour and babysitting behaviour (where semi-independent fledglings follow adults between foraging sites and away from predators). The breeding season extends from late-September to early April, although this varies between years and is strongly rain-dependent. Groups can raise up to three successful clutches per breeding season. Average incubation time is 14 days, and average time between hatching and fledging is 16 days. Fledging time varies according to <span>group size</span>: small groups tend to fledge their young earlier than large groups. Post-fledging, young are poorly mobile, unable to fly, and rely entirely on adult group members for food. Fledgling foraging efficiency develops slowly, and fledglings can continue to be provisioned by adults for up to four months post-fledging. The amount of care that young receive during this stage has long-term effects: fledglings that receive care for the longest periods tend to be heavier and better foragers than their counterparts. In addition, they are more likely to successfully disperse from their natal group and consequently begin reproducing earlier than their &#x201C;failed-disperser&#x201D; counterparts.</p>

<p>Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are very similar to common bottlenose dolphins in appearance. Common bottlenose dolphins have a reasonably strong body, moderate-length beak, and tall, curved dorsal fins; whereas Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins have a more slender body build and their beak is longer and more slender. The Indo-Pacific population also tends to have a somewhat lighter blue colour and the cape is generally more distinct, with a light spinal blaze extending to below the dorsal fin. However, although not always present, the most obvious distinction can be made with the presence of black spots or flecks on the bellies of adults of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, which are very rare in common bottlenose dolphins. Their teeth can number between 23 and 29 in each upper and lower jaw, and are more slender than those of common bottlenose dolphins. Size of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins can vary based on geographic location; however, its average length is 2.6 metres (8.5 ft) long, and it weighs up to 230 kilograms (510 lb).

<p>The barn owl is considered to be the most widespread landbird species in the world, occurring in every continent except Antarctica. Its range includes all of Europe (except Fennoscandia and Malta), most of Africa apart from the Sahara, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, the Pacific Islands, North, Central and South America. In general it is considered to be sedentary, and indeed many individuals, having taken up residence in a particular location, remain there even when better foraging areas nearby are vacant. In the British Isles, the young seem to largely disperse along river corridors and the distance travelled from their natal site averages about 9 km (5.6 mi). In continental Europe the distance travelled is greater, commonly somewhere between 50 and 100 kilometres (31 and 62 mi) but exceptionally 1,500 km (932 mi), with ringed birds from the Netherlands ending up in Spain and in Ukraine. In the United States, dispersal is typically over distances of 80 and 320 km (50 and 199 mi), with the most travelled individuals ending up some 1,760 km (1,094 mi) from the point of departure. Movements in the African continent include 1,000 km (621 mi) from Senegambia to Sierra Leone and up to 579 km (360 mi) within South Africa. In Australia there is some migration as the birds move towards the northern coast in the dry season and southward in the wet, and also nomadic movements in association with rodent plagues. Occasionally, some of these birds turn up on <span>Norfolk Island</span>, <span>Lord Howe Island</span> or <span>New Zealand</span>, showing that crossing the ocean is not beyond their capabilities.</p>

using('tyto alba')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>This is a <span>bird</span> of open country such as <span>farmland</span> or <span>grassland</span> with some interspersed <span>woodland</span>, usually below 2,000 m <span>ASL</span> but occasionally as high as 3,000 m ASL in the <span>tropics</span>. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters pastures or similar hunting grounds. Like most owls, the barn owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its <span>flight feathers</span> and a hairlike fringe to the trailing edges help to break up the flow of air over the wings, thereby reducing <span>turbulence</span> and the noise that accompanies it. Hairlike extensions to the <span>barbules</span> of its feathers, which give the plumage a soft feel, also minimise noise produced during wingbeats. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighboring subspecies, as shown in the case of the European <i>T. a. guttata</i> and <i>T. a. alba</i> that probably evolved, respectively, in <span>allopatric</span> <span>glacial refugia</span> in southeastern Europe, and in <span>Iberia</span> or southern <span>France</span>.</p>

<p>The barn owl hunts by flying slowly, quartering the ground and hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, and this is the main means of prey location in the <span>oil palm</span> plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about 23% of their bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be utilised when food is scarce.</p>

using('tyto alba')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Once a pair-bond has been formed, the male will make short flights at dusk around the nesting and roosting sites and then longer circuits to establish a home range. When he is later joined by the female, there is much chasing, turning and twisting in flight, and frequent screeches, the male's being high-pitched and tremulous and the female's lower and harsher. At later stages of courtship, the male emerges at dusk, climbs high into the sky and then swoops back to the vicinity of the female at speed. He then sets off to forage. The female meanwhile sits in an eminent position and <span>preens</span>, returning to the nest a minute or two before the male arrives with food for her. She apparently detects his imminent arrival in some way indiscernible to a human observer. Such feeding behaviour of the female by the male is common, helps build the pair-bond and increases the female's fitness before egg-laying commences.</p>

using('tyto alba')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>Before starting to lay eggs, the female spends her time near the nest and is entirely provisioned by the male. Meanwhile the male roosts nearby and may <span>cache</span> any prey that is surplus to their requirements. When the female has reached peak weight, the male provides a ritual presentation of food and copulation occurs at the nest. The female lays eggs on alternate days and clutch size averages about five, varying from about two to nine. The eggs are chalky white, somewhat elliptical and about the size of bantams' eggs, and incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid. While she is sitting on the nest, the male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may pile up beside the female. The incubation period is about thirty days, hatching takes place over a prolonged period and the youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling. In years with plentiful supplies of food, there may be a hatching success rate of about 75%. The male continues to copulate with the female when he brings food which makes the newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury.</p>

<p>Feathers become abraded over time and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are particularly dependent on their ability to fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when she flies little and the male feeds her and the young chicks. The first <span>primary feather</span> to be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.</p>

using('tyto alba')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>In temperate areas, the male owl moults rather later in the year than the female, at a time when there is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting but the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.</p>

<p>Unusually for such a medium-sized <span>carnivorous</span> animal, the barn owl exhibits <span>r-selection</span>, producing large number of offspring with a high growth rate, many of which have a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. While wild barn owls are thus decidedly short-lived, the actual <span>longevity</span> of the species is much higher - captive individuals may reach twenty years of age or more. But occasionally, a wild bird reaches an advanced age. The American record age for a wild barn owl is eleven and a half years, while a Dutch bird was noted to have reached an age of seventeen years, ten months. Another captive barn owl, in England, lived to be over twenty-five years old. Taking into account such extremely long-lived individuals, the average lifespan of the barn owl is about four years, and statistically two-thirds to three-quarters of all adults survive from one year to the next. But as noted above, the <span>mortality</span> is not evenly distributed throughout the bird's life, and only one young in three manages to live to its first breeding attempt. Causes of death are variable but the most significant one in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of <span>pesticides</span>, and this may still be the case in some parts of the world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.</p>

<p>Common names such as "demon owl", "death owl", or "ghost owl" show that for long, rural populations in many places considered barn owls to be birds of evil <span>omen</span>. Consequently, they were often persecuted by farmers, unaware of the benefit these birds bring. As late as 1975, hunting by fearful locals was limiting the population of <i>T. a. gracilirostris</i> on <span>Fuerteventura</span>. In current times, rodenticide poisoning is the main threat for the Canary barn owl, which in the <span>Chinijo Archipelago</span> is on the verge of disappearance while on Fuerteventura only a few dozen pairs remain overall. There, the abandonment of much agricultural land and the subsequent decline of rodent pests seem to have decreased the owl's numbers even further. Only on <span>Lanzarote</span> does a somewhat larger number of these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than 300 and perhaps less than 200 birds still exist, and it is classified as <i>insuficientemente conocida</i> ("<span>data deficient</span>") by the Spanish <span>Ministry of Environment</span>. Similarly, the birds on the western <span>Canary Islands</span> which are usually assigned to the <span>nominate subspecies</span> (though this seems suspect on grounds of <span>biogeography</span>) have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem to be not uncommon, while on the other islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to the assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland <span>Spain</span>, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.</p>

The female Cape fox has a gestation period of 51 to 53 days and gives birth to a litter of one to six cubs (or kits). Reared underground in burrows, the cubs will stay close to the den until they are about four months old. They are weaned at around six to eight weeks of age, but do not begin to forage until they are four months old. Cubs usually become independent at five months of age, at which point they will disperse (typically in June or July). They typically weigh from 50 to 100 grams (1.7 - 3.5 ounces) at birth. Both parents will care for the young, with the male also providing for the female during the first two weeks. A family group usually consists of the parents and their offspring, but different family groups sometimes mix during feeding. Multiple litters are possible and have been observed; however, the female usually chases out the cubs from the last litter when she is expecting another one. Cape foxes are fully grown within about a year, with both the female and the male reaching sexual maturity at 9 months.

<p>Slightly larger than the <span>Common Sandpiper</span> at 22-25 cm length, its long upcurved bill - somewhat reminiscent of an <span>avocet</span>'s, but not as strongly curved - makes it very distinctive. As the scientific specific name implies, this wader has a grey back, face and breast in all <span>plumages</span>; a white <span>supercilium</span> may appear more or less distinct. The belly is whitish and the feet yellow; the <span>bill</span> has a yellowish base, with the rest being black.</p>

<p>Striped ground squirrels are moderately large ground squirrels, ranging from 22 to 29 centimetres (8.7 to 11.4 in) in length, with a tail that, at 19 to 26 centimetres (7.5 to 10.2 in), is nearly as long as the body. Adults weigh between 0.5 and 1 kilogram (1.1 and 2.2 lb). They have a coat of short, bristly fur, and are pale sandy to dark brown across most of the body, with whitish, nearly hairless, underparts. A narrow stripe of pure white fur runs down the flanks from the shoulders to the hips. The tail has hairs much longer than those on the body, which fan out to the sides, and are multi-coloured along their length, presenting a grizzled appearance. The ears are small, and the muzzle long, with a projecting, almost pointed, nose. The limbs are pale, with large feet and long, straight, claws. They can be distinguished from the otherwise similar <span>Cape</span> and <span>mountain ground squirrels</span> by the fact that female striped ground squirrels possess three pairs of teats, rather than just two.</p>

<p>Striped ground squirrels live alone, or in pairs, and greet other members of their species by sniffing each other nose-to-nose. They move with a jumping gait, frequently pausing to sniff or look around, and making longer leaps when they need to move more quickly. They normally hold their tail horizontally when moving, or upright when still, and can fluff it up into a "bottle-brush" when alarmed. They can make a chattering sound, similar to that of other squirrels.</p>

<p>Cape ground squirrels live mainly in arid or semiarid areas. They prefer to live in <span>velds</span> and grasslands with hard ground. They can also be found in scrub along pans, on floodplains and in agricultural areas. Ground squirrel are generally active during the day and do not hibernate. They are burrowing animals that dig and live in clusters of burrows averaging around 700 square metres (7,500 sq ft) with 2-100 entrances. Burrow serve to protect the squirrel from extreme temperatures at the surface as well as predators. Nevertheless most of the day is spent feeding at the surface. For thermoregulation, ground squirrels shade their head and back with their bushy tails. Dust bathing is also done. Ground squirrels eat bulbs, fruits, grasses, herbs, insects and shrubs. They do not hoard food so foraging is a daily activity. The Cape ground squirrel usually doesn't have to drink and it gets moisture from the food it eats. A ground squirrel&#x2019;s daily activities are made of around 70% feeding, 15-20% being vigilant and around 10% socializing. The burrows of Cape ground squirrels are also used by <span>meerkats</span> and <span>yellow mongooses</span>. While Cape ground squirrels and meerkats appear to have a <span>mutual</span> relationships, mongoose and squirrel relations appear to be more <span>commensal</span>. Predators of grounds squirrels include jackals, snakes and monitor lizards. Ground squirrels may be able to scent the differences in the dropping of predators and non-predators. When threatened by predators, like snakes, ground squirrel will engage in <span>mobbing behavior</span>. Multiple squirrels will rush at the predator while using their bushy tails to block it. When the predator strikes back, all the squirrels back off. However, multiple mobbings are generally successful in driving anyway predators.</p>

<p>Cape ground squirrel mate and reproduce year-round but mating occurs mostly in dry winter months. Since females copulate with multiple males, the males' large testes are useful for <span>sperm competition</span>. After copulation, males will <span>masturbate</span> which could serve to keep the genitals clean and reduce the risk of <span>sexually transmitted infections</span>. In groups, only one females at a time enters estrous which lasts around three hours. Gestation lasts around 48 days or 42-49 days. Lactation begins not long before the pups are born. A lactating female isolates herself in a separate burrow to care for their young but she returns to her group after weaning or if her litter is lost for some reason. There are 1-3 pups in a litter. They are born altricial, hairless and blind. The pups stay in the burrows for their first 45 days. By 35 days, the eyes are open. Seven days after emerging from the burrows, the pups can eat solid food. Lactation ends at around 52 days. Males reach sexual maturity at eight months while female mature at 10 months. The former leave their natal groups while the latter remain.</p>

using('xerus princeps')['size'] = [{'from': nil, 'to': nil, 'dimension': ''}]
<p>It is the closest relative of the <span>Cape Ground Squirrel</span> (Latin name <i>Xerus inauris</i>), which is so similar in appearance that the two are difficult to distinguish in the field. Both species have long bushy black and white tails with a white stripe from the shoulder towards the rump. <i>Xerus princeps</i> is slightly larger, on average, than <i>X. inauris</i>, although there is considerable overlap in body size. Differences in skull <span>morphology</span> also distinguish the two species, and the <span>incisors</span> are yellow to orange rather than white as in <i>X. inauris</i>.</p>

<p>Cuvier's beaked whale has a short beak in comparison with other species in its <span>family</span>, with a slightly bulbous <span>melon</span>. The melon is white or creamy in color and a white strip runs back to the <span>dorsal fin</span> about two-thirds of the way along the back. The rest of the body color varies by individual: some are dark grey; others a reddish-brown. Individuals commonly have white scars and patches caused by <span>cookiecutter sharks</span>. The dorsal fin varies in shape from triangular to highly falcate, whilst the <span>fluke</span> is about one-quarter the body length. They live for forty years.</p>

<p>Cuvier's beaked whale feeds on several species of <span>squid</span>, including those in the families <span>Cranchiidae</span>, <span>Onychoteuthidae</span>, <span>Brachioteuthidae</span>, <span>Enoploteuthidae</span>, <span>Octopoteuthidae</span> and <span>Histioteuthidae</span>; it also preys on deep-sea fish. In 2014, scientists reported that they had used satellite-linked tags to track Cuvier's beaked whales off the coast of California and found the animals dove up to 2,992 meters (nearly two miles) below the ocean surface and spent up to two hours and 17 minutes underwater before resurfacing, which represent both the deepest and the longest dives ever documented for any mammal.</p>
